<h3>About this Course</h3>

<p>This course is the third in our JavaScript for Beginners Specialization.
The scripts will become more complex and introduce more complex jQuery
plugins. You will have several challenges to practice your skills
throughout the course.</p>

<p>The course objectives include how to identify objects in JavaScript;
create new objects and populate them with data; manipulate objects by
adding, modifying and deleting data in objects; manipulate the DOM based
on the data in objects; identify and articulate how multiple functions
work together to create a more complex program; and identify processes
for breaking larger programs into smaller, more manageable pieces.</p>

<h4>
Combining Scripts and Skill Building Through Practice
</h4>
<p>
In this module, you will be able to use jQuery to create a smooth scroll
effect for in-page navigation, as well as develop a script, using
jQuery, that keeps track of scroll positions on the page. You will be
able to compare and contrast the in-page smooth scroll script and the
location tracking script created using jQuery with one created using
plain JavaScript. You will be able to build a webpage using HTML and CSS
that will combine some of the different scripts created in this course.
You will be able to combine some of the different scripts and jQuery
plugins explored in this course into the Scription webpage through a
series of challenges.

<p>Hello and welcome to our 3rd course in our four-core specialization
on JavaScript. My name is Bill Mead and I'm back again to do more
JavaScript with you. Hopefully you've completed our first two courses on
JavaScript and you've learned a lot about the syntax of JavaScript and
how to solve problems with JavaScript. It takes a lot of practice to get
good at this stuff.</p>
I'm back again to do more with you to introduce some new concepts, to do
some new projects and to do some more sophisticated projects and give
you even more practice. You get even better with JavaScript and jQuery.
We're going to do a lot in this course. Let's break out our code editors
and our web browsers and get started and learn even more about
JavaScript.

Hello and welcome to our first module in our third course on JavaScript.
In this module, we're going to dive even deeper into jQuery, looking at
some jQuery plugins. You've already made some sliders in a previous
lesson. But in this lesson, we'll look at the <b>flex slider</b> plugin,
which adds a lot of features, two sliders and comparing that to what
you've done manually by creating your own sliders is really instructive
and useful. Plus, you end up with a great tool for creating slider
elements on web pages and that's really pretty fun.

Just as a quick recap, we've learned a lot of JavaScript so far.

  width="40%;" />
</p>
We started with the JavaScript basics, which included working with
variables, flow control structures like if statements and else
statements and loops, and that stuff. We created reusable functions that
you can use in multiple projects or you can use multiple times within
the same project. We've manipulated the DOM and handled events such as
when somebody clicks on something or hovers a mouse over something, we
can capture those events and then do things with them. With these
basics, you can do quite a lot, but it might take you a long time to
write the scripts that you want to do for your web page.

  alt="Recap: jQuery."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000;" 
  width="40%;" />
</p>
Then we had jQuery and your world became a little bit larger. With
jQuery, we've learned that there are a lot of helper functions built
into this library that make writing scripts shorter and a little bit
more compact, and a little bit easier. That helps and that makes things
a little bit easier and a little bit better for all of us.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 08. introducing: plugins (11) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image008.webp" 
  alt="Introducing: Plugins."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000;" 
  width="40%;" />
</p>
<p>Now we need to introduce plugins. We've already used the
<b>easing</b> plugin, which is a very simple plugin that adds additional
function to jQuery, so that you can use different types of
<b>easing,</b> which is different speeds and ways in which things can
animate on your screen, and by plugging in that particular plugin, you
get access to all of those different features that aren't built into
jQuery.</p>
jQuery has this plugin architecture that's very powerful, that allows
developers to build extensions to jQuery. They give it a lot of
additional functionality. There are tons of jQuery plugins available,
thousands of them, and I recommend looking around the web and seeing
what other ones you can find. We will look at one or two here in this
course, but there are just thousands of them out there and they're
really worth exploring and seeing what's out there. That way your world
becomes a lot bigger because now you don't only have to just write all
your scripts yourself. You can look for scripts that other people have
written and see if you can modify them and use them in your own projects
through the use of a plugin, and that's really very powerful and really
great.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 09. adding functionality (12) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image009.webp" 
  alt="Adding Functionality."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000;" 
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>Again, <b>plugins</b> add additional functionality to jQuery, and
we've already seen this with the <b>easing plugin.</b> But some plugins
can have very complex functionality without us having to write a whole
bunch of code. We have access to a whole bunch of additional functions
and we'll see what that looks like.</p>
<p>You can create whole interfaces in a jQuery plugin, and then by
providing that plugin, other people can have access to those interfaces.
For example, we did the project where we made the tabbed interface. What
if there was a jQuery plugin that made hooking up a tabbed interface
super easy? There are plugins for those things and they might come with
a lot of features and functionality. What if you want the tabs to run
down the side of the tabbed interface rather than across the tab? You
could do that thing.</p>
<h2 name="ch1-04">

  alt="1.04. Using Plugins and Essential Steps."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000;" 
  width="40%;" />
</p>
<p>Using plugins and essential steps, adding plugins to your project,
configuring them, and learning how to use them still takes some work and
effort. But not nearly as much work and effort as it takes to write the
whole script yourself.</p>
Many of the larger, more sophisticated plugins require five steps to get
them to work.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 11. using plugins and essential steps, #2 (13) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image011.webp" 
  alt="Using Plugins and Essential Steps, #2."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000;" 
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p><b><mark>[Step 1]</mark></b> is, you have to use the markup indicated
by the plugin documentation. Often, you'll have to use divs or our
articles or other elements with particular classes that the plugin needs
in order for it to actually work. Classes or IDs or other, structures
that the plugin needs to work.</p>
<p><b><mark>[Step 2]</mark>,</b> you need to make sure jQuery is linked.
The jQuery libraries linked because if you're using a jQuery plugin,
then you need to have jQuery decide if you're going to put your scripts
at the top of the page or at the bottom of the page. Sometimes you can
put them whichever place you want, sometimes the plugin directions will
tell you to put them in one place or the other. But frequently you can
make your own decision on this and put it where you want it to go and
architect your file the way you want it to be structured.</p>
<p><b><mark>[Step 3]</mark>,</b> is to link the plugin file and when you
download a plugin, frequently it will come with a compressed version and
an uncompressed version. The uncompressed version is there for you to
look at so you could see how the plugin actually functions, it's
readable JavaScript, and you can do that kind of thing. But when you're
ready to put it into your project and for your production ready project,
you want to use the compressed version because it will be smaller, and
it'll download faster. So, if they provide a compressed one, then you
should use that, if they don't provide a compressed one, you can
compress it yourself.</p>
<p><b><mark>[Step 4]</mark>,</b> link to the plug in CSS file, some of
the fancier plugins will come with styling that will style the elements
inside of the plugin. And, this is usually included so that everything
looks and works the way it's supposed to work within the interface for
that plugin, so you want to make sure you get that CSS file linked onto
your page.</p>
Then <b><mark>[Step 5]</mark></b>, is you need to initialize the setup
of the plugin in your own script tag, or on your own linked JavaScript
file. Often, you can set additional options so that when the function is
initialized, and so that you can pass in whichever options will get the
plugin to display the way you want it to display, but you want to make
sure that this script loads last. So, the order of things are that you
will have the markup for the jQuery plugin, then you'll have jQuery,
then the jQuery plugin, and then you will initialize the plugin on your
own script. And then also make sure that if there's any CSS files, those
are included as well.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 12. documentation mish-mash (15) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image012.webp"
  alt="Documentation Mish-Mash."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000;" 
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>Suppose you find a jQuery plugin you want to try on your website, how
do you go about adding it to your page? How do you know what to do?
Because these plugins are all made by different developers or groups of
developers, there's no real standard in terms of the documentation. This
is where having a solid foundation in JavaScript really helps, because
you need to look at the documentation they provide, and be able to tease
it out and go okay, I understand what they're asking me to do here.</p>
On this page they're telling me to install the plugin like this and then
add these configuration options, and so on and so forth. And unless you
have some experience with JavaScript, it's going to look like a bunch of
messy code and it's not going to make a lot of sense. So that's why it's
really helpful to have a solid JavaScript foundation, before trying to
mess around with this stuff. But now that you do, and you'll see once
you work with a few plugins that many of them work pretty much the same
way. The documentation may look a little bit different; the directions
may be written a little bit different, but it's the same basic steps
each time.

</p>
<p><b><mark>[Number 1]</mark></b> on this list is the biggest one, I see
this all the time, especially with students who are new to working with
JavaScript in jQuery, and that is ending up with multiple copies of the
jQuery library linked to your page.</p>
<p>Only load the jQuery library once. You may have multiple plugins, but
you should only load one copy of the jQuery library, which is used by
all the plugins. What happens is you find a plugin that add some
interesting functionality web page. You follow the directions and load
the jQuery library and do all the directions to make that plugin work.
Then you find another plugin that does something else that you want to
use. You follow the directions and that page and it tells you to load
the jQuery library and to load the plugins. You follow those directions
and then in the end, you end up with the jQuery library loaded twice.
Frequently, when you download these plugins, they'll include a copy of
the jQuery library. You'll follow the directions, you'll link up one,
then you'll think of another.</p>
<p>It turns out that the two plugins hooked up actually are using
different versions of the same jQuery library. Now you've got two
different versions of the jQuery library linked up, and that's going to
cause all problems and things will break and it won't work right. You
want to make sure you only ever have one copy of the jQuery library
plugin. I'm saying this now, but I promise it'll happen. How I see this
is the most common error that I see from students who are working with
jQuery is the follow the directions and they wind up with multiple
copies, different versions of the jQuery library plugged in. That's the
number 1 Gotcha. It happens a lot.</p>
<p>The second, <b><mark>[number 2]</mark></b> thing is file management.
When you download a plugin, sometimes plugins require other files,
whether it's CSS files or maybe an images folder, fonts or something
else. You want to make sure that when you put those files in your
folder, everything is going into the correct spot and is linked
properly. Because for the web, remember, everything is linked. All the
files are linked to each other. If those links become broken, then your
project won't work and it won't work properly. Make sure you have all
the correct files and all the correct places for the plugin to work.
That's <b>number 2</b>, those two issues comprise 90 percent of the
problems that people have with plugins, it's probably those two
problems.</p>
<p>The next thing, <b><mark>[number 3]</mark></b> is top of the page
versus bottom of the page. Make sure you're placing your plugins scripts
in the correct place. Some of them may require you to load jQuery up at
the top of the page. Usually, you can put them where you want as long as
you run the scripts properly.</p>
<p>But make sure you have a strategy for where your JavaScript is going
to load, whether you're going to have it load at the bottom of the page
before the closing body tag, or whether you're going to put the links to
scripts up in the top of the page and maybe use the defer attribute to
make sure they don't load into the whole page is loaded. Keep that in
mind.</p>
<p>Now, jQuery has a document ready method, <b><mark>[number
4]</mark></b> that will check to see that the DOM is flooded before
anything inside the <b>document_ready</b> function runs. That's just
checking to make sure your HTML is loaded. Sometimes people will provide
plugins and tell you to use the document ready function. You'll need
that if you're up at the top of the page and you're not using the
deferred attribute. But if you put it at the bottom of the page, you may
not need it. There's also a window load method, and that's in older
versions of jQuery version 2 and lower. It's now been replaced with
<b>window.on</b> and the load and you pass in load as the event that
we're looking for and then run an anonymous function, which is what we
used in the previous lesson with the sliders. Be aware about these
different functions, what they do, which versions of jQuery they work
with and that stuff, because if you're reading the documentation for a
plugin, it could be older documentation. If their documentation is
telling you to use <b>window.load,</b> but you're using the most recent
version of the jQuery library, you'll have to switch it to the
<b>window.on</b> method and use that one instead. You want to make sure
that you're using these functions properly. Really where you're going to
use these is just where you're initializing your script. Has nothing to
do with loading the actual script file or the plugin file. This is where
you initialize your script on your page where you're tying the plugin to
run. You'll need to make sure you use these functions properly.</p>
Then the last, <b><mark>[number 5]</mark></b> is overriding CSS on your
stylesheet. If you want to customize the look of the plugin and you
should put your rules that override the styles they've set on their
specified CSS file, on your CSS file and then make sure your CSS file
loads last. That way, when your CSS loads, it will override the access
on their stylesheet. You don't want to overwrite the styles on their
access file because if you ever update the plugin files, you'll lose
that and you'll have to do it again. You want to make sure you put it on
your CSS file.

  alt="5 Items of Beware the Plugins."

</p>
<p>One last topic that I have to talk about before we're done with this
lecture and plugins is just to beware of the plug in. Plugins can add
bloat to your project with a lot of additional code that you may not
need. All of the features, plugged features that are programmed into the
plugin, but you may be only using one or two. That's something to be
aware of. Without modification, plugins can make your site look generic,
so if you're not updating the CSS file or adding your own styles to it,
then it could look the same as everybody else's website.</p>
<p>Plugins can turn us into lazy designers looking for a quick fix.
Rather than actually trying to solve our interaction design problem, we
go look for a plugin that looks cool and interesting. That may not
really be the right fit for a project just to avoid having to do some
custom code. Watch out for that.</p>
Also, plugins can be poorly written. They can have all bugs built into
them because they're made by other developers. You don't really know.
You really have to test them out and research them, find out who else is
using them, what problems if they had, what sorts of things work well
with them. It'll take time to do the research, but probably less time
than actually writing the code yourself from scratch if it's an
extensive plugin. It's worth it to make sure that the plugin you're
using is really worthwhile.

</p>
<p>Getting used to using other people's code now via jQuery plugins is a
good preparation for the future. If you get deeper into JavaScript
coding, we might use other repositories of shared code, such as NPM,
which is the world's largest software registry. Then having experience
with jQuery plug ins will really help you out. It's very common in the
software development world to be working on modularized blocks of code
and working with plugins can be seen as an introduction to that way of
thinking and working where you're taking functionality and separating it
out into a separate file and then plugging it in. You have access to
that. It's a really great way of thinking and working with JavaScript in
jQuery in general and getting used to that here will help prepare you
for a future as a JavaScript developer.</p>

1.06. FlexSlider: A jQuery Plugin (6:38)
</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 17. flexslider: a jquery plugin (21) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image017.webp" 
  alt="1.06. FlexSlider: A jQuery Plugin."
  style="border: 2px solid black;"
  width="40%;" />
</p>
Now that we've talked about jQuery plug-ins a bit, let's take a look at
one that we can use to add a significant amount of interface options to
our page.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 18. basic flexslider (21) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image018.webp" 
  alt="Basic FlexSlider."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>The FlexSlider is a good one to look at. Partially because we've been
working on image sliders, so, we come to this with the context of having
created some sliders on our own, so, we can see what this particular
plug-in has offered that's different from what we coated ourselves in
the previous lessons. That's fun.</p>
The other thing that's nice about FlexSlider, it's called FlexSlider
because it's a responsive slider.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 19/20. responsive kittens for sale (22) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image019.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:40%"
  alt="Responsive Kittens for Sale Web Page, #1." />
<img src="./images/webp/image020.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:40%"
  alt="Responsive Kittens for Sale Web Page, #2." />
</p>
I've opened up the page over here and you can see if I pull this off and
resize it, the page is responsive and it squishes and stretches, and so,
we can actually create a slider that will work for different screen
sizes using FlexSlider. That's fun.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 21. markup for web site (22) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image021.webp" 
  alt="Markup for Kittens for Sale Web Page."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
If you look at the markup, you'll notice that it's pretty basic. If you
download the start files that come with this lesson, I have in here some
basic markup.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 22/23. responsive kittens for sale (23) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image022.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Responsive Kittens for Sale Web Page, #1." />    
<img src="./images/webp/image023.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Responsive Kittens for Sale Web Page, #2." />
</p>
This is where the actual slider will go, and then I've just got some
columns and some articles, and then the styling is all in place on the
CSS file that includes some media queries for when the screen gets
larger or smaller. The media queries, will handle the sizing of stuff on
the page, and there's just a few rules in there just because this is
pretty basic, but there we have it. We'll make a slider about kittens
because, who doesn't love kittens? Kittens are awesome.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 24. responsive media queries (23) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image024.webp" 
  alt="Responsive Media Queries."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
We looked at the media queries and they'll handle the screen if it's
wider than 600 pixels. Up to 600 pixels you just get a very basic
layout, and then once you get larger than that, it will give you a more
of a layout on the page with the columns. Okay.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 25. flexslider website (24) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image025.webp" 
  alt="FlexSlider Website."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Then the next thing is the FlexSlider Website and the FlexSlider Script.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 26. flexslider website, #2 (24) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image026.webp" 
  alt="FlexSlider Website, #2."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
If you go to the FlexSlider Website, which is here, you can download
FlexSlider or you can click on the Live Demo. It's posted by WooCommerce
and they have the basic directions here with some additional
functionality that we'll look at, and this is the documentation for how
to use FlexSlider right here on this page, and you can download the
files to get started. However, I've already provided the same files with
this lesson, so, you don't have to go there and download them, they're
also included with this lesson.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 27. flexslider website, #3 (25) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image027.webp" 
  alt="FlexSlider Website, #3."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Get those files first by either clicking the Download button here or by
downloading the FlexSlider files of this lesson.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 28. files needed: flexslider website (25) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image028.webp" 
  alt="Files Needed for FlexSlider Website."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Now, when you get those files, the FlexSlider files, you're going to
need to figure out what you need in order to actually make the
FlexSlider work in your project. This is a little bit confusing,
especially if you're not that familiar with this thing. Let me go
through it carefully, because you're likely to run into this with other
plug-ins as well.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 29/30. folder with website and images (26) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image029.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Folder with website." />    
<img src="./images/webp/image030.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Folder with images." />
</p>
Here on the left, I have my folder with my website in it, that's my
index page, I've got a JavaScript file, I've got slides which have
different slides for the different pictures of the kittens, and I've got
my style-sheet, that's what's in my folder.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 31/32. unzipped download files (26) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image031.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Unzipped download files." />    
<img src="./images/webp/image032.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Other unzipped download files." />
</p>
<p>Over here, these are the files that got downloaded. When I unzipped
the FlexSlider folder this is what I got. You might wonder what some of
this stuff is, bower-components and <b>bower.json</b>. Bower is a build
tool that's used to combine stuff together, so, we can ignore those. The
change-log will show different versions of the program, composer is a
different build tool, contributing is another file that talks about it.
If you look in the CSS folder, you'll see there's a bunch of ‘less’
files that compile down into basic CSS files, so, we don't need that.
The Demo will run to show the Demos of the different versions of the
FlexSlider, so, you don't need those files, but you can look at them if
you want to. Then we've got some files down here. We've got a less
version, we've got a CSS, we got an rtl.css and rtl-min.css, fonts,
images, all this stuff.</p>
Really the only things that we need in our folder are the actual plugin
and we want the minified version, notice here, the non-minified version
is 57KB, the minified version is less than half of that in size. We want
people to have to download the smallest file possible. We need the CSS
file and we're actually going to need this fonts folder. The fonts
folder includes a font that as the next button in the previous button
that will show up on the slider, so, we need that in order for this
‘next’ and ‘previous’ buttons to load properly. We will need that as
well.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 33/34. flexslider.css, fonts & minified flexslider (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image033.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="flexslider.css, fonts and jquery.flexslider-min.js." />    
<img src="./images/webp/image034.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="flexslider.css, fonts and jquery.flexslider-min.js." />
</p>
I'm going to grab the FlexSlider.css, the fonts, and the minified
version of FlexSlider. Just those three files, the rest of it I don't
need. I'm going to put them into my project folder over here so that I
have them, and that gets us all the files that we need in order to get
started for this project.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch1-07">
1.07. About the Minified Version (5:55)
</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 35. about the minified version (1.07) (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image035.webp"
  alt="1.07. About the Minified Version."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="40%;" />
</p>
And again, I'm just repeating myself here but it's really important that
you understand this.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 36. minified vs non-minified (28) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image036.webp"
  alt="Minified vs. Non-Minified jQuery FlexSlider.js."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
The Minified version is the same file with all the same with all the
white space removed and a few other things done to make the file smaller
and faster to download. Use that version if it's available for any plug
in that you want to use. The non-modified version is available if you
want to see the actual JavaScript or maybe even edited, but you'll
probably never want to do that. So, we'll always use the Minified
version.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 37. add javascript flexslider files (28) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image037.webp"
  alt="Add 3 files to project: flexslider.css, jquery.flexslider-min.js and fonts."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
And again, these are the files that we actually need for our project.
So, we're going to copy them over and put them into our project folder
just like you see here and just like we did just a minute ago in the
previous lesson.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 38. add 3 files to head of index (29) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image038.webp"
  alt="Add stylesheet and 2 javascript files to head of index."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Next, it's about following the directions to make the flex slider work,
and you can come back to the flex slider website and I recommend that
you do this. Even though I'm going to walk through doing it with you,
it's good to sort of come in here and see how these directions are
written and to understand what the steps are.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 39. link to 3 files and add markup (29) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image039.webp"
  alt="Link files and add markup."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
First, link the files, then add the markup, then hook up your slider,
and then tailor its units with special stuff down here. And if you're
new to this, this may look a little bit confusing and difficult, but
it's really not. And, also it may be written differently for different
plug ins. It's important to know a little bit about how JavaScript works
in order to get this stuff to work, right? Once you've done it a few
times for a few different plug ins, you'll see there's a lot of
similarities.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 40. following directions (30) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image040.webp"
  alt="Following Directions."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
All right, so let's go through this together. So, you can see what I
mean about how to do this.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 41. styles.css and load jquery (30) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image041.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 42/43. where to put scripts, css & js (31) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image042.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="." />     <img src="./images/webp/image043.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>First, we can look at where these scripts go, and over here, notice
this one is listing jQuery 1.6.2, that's a really old version of jQuery.
And then we've got the flex slider JS here, we've got the CSS file. I'd
rather load up the most recent version of jQuery rather than the old
version of jQuery.</p>
Let's go over to our files over here. And on our index page, up at the
top of the page, this is where we want to put a link to the flex slider
CSS. So, I'm just going to add a link here, link href = "
flexslider.css". Don't forget rel ="stylesheet", and make sure you spell
style sheet right. Okay, so that will link that up. You can see I've got
jquery 2.2.4 loaded here, as opposed to the 1.6.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 44. jquery version to load (31) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image044.webp"
  alt="jQuery version to load."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
But I'm actually going to load the most recent version of jQuery. So,
I'm going to come back here and I'm going to go and look for jquery cdn
in google, Google Hosted Libraries. I'm going to go find jquery. And
here is the latest version of jquery. You'll notice it's been updated
recently to 3.6, okay. So, I'm going to replace this version of jquery
with that one.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 45. load jquery at bottom of screen (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image045.webp"
  alt="Load jQuery at bottom of screen."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
But notice I need to go back and add the <b>defer</b>, I want to put
<b>defer</b> back in here because really, I want this script to load at
the bottom of the screen. Okay, now I want to load the jQuery Flexslider
script.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 46. add scripts to index.html (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image046.webp"
  alt="Where to add scripts to index.html."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
So, I'm going to put that in here, script src equals quote, and I want
this one, that's the plug in. I'm going to load that one next, and then
I've got my script file here and it's currently empty, but I want to
load that file last, script as we are seeing, equals quote myscript.js.
There we go, I've got the files loaded. So, what's the next thing that
we need to do? If we come back to the directions, it says place
somewhere in the head of your document.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 47. defer scripts loading; jquery, plugin, my script (33) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image047.webp"
  alt="Defer script load; jQuery libary, then plugins, then my script."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
The other thing I want to do is I want to put the defer attribute on my
script. Let's do that too. Because we want to make sure that it loads
after the jQuery library. So, I want to put defer here, and defer down
here. So, that they will load in this order, first this library, then
the plug in, then my script. And they'll load after the rest of the page
is loaded, just to be certain. So, we've got that, okay.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 48. add markup with div, flexslider, ul and li images (33) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image048.webp"
  alt="Add Markup container with div, FlexSlider, ul and li images."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
The next thing we need to do is to add the markup, and this is the
markup this plug in expects. It expects a <b>div</b> with the class,
<b>flexslider</b>, and a <b>ul</b> with the class slides, then list
items with the images inside of it, and we'll do that in the next
lesson.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch1-08">

</p>
In the last lesson, we got all of our files linked and everything hooked
up so that it should all be ready to work. You want to make sure that
your stylesheet loads after the FlexSlider style sheets, that you can
modify changes there. We'll get to more on that later.

  alt="Step 2 FlexSlider, add markup, div, ul and li images."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Now, we're ready to actually come down here and make our markup work the
way it's supposed to work. If we come back to our slides and our
directions, it says to make the markup look like this. This is what we
need to do. This is what this particular script requires. It requires a
div with the class of FlexSlider and unordered list of the class of
slides, and then we can actually put our images inside each list item
for that unordered list.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 51. index.html, div class='flexslider' (35) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image051.webp"
  alt="Add flexslider class to div and slides class to ul."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Let's go over here and set this up the same way. We need a div, we need
a class, equals FlexSlider on here. This needs a class equals slides.
Then down here, we can have list items with our different pictures in
here, and I'm just going to copy this one and paste it. Over here in the
folder, I have slides and I have seven of them. I have seven kittens
here. Let's go ahead and add the six more times. 1,2,3,4,5,6, and then
just change these numbers, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. That will give us seven
slides with seven kittens, one on each side. That's great.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 52. verify classes on div and ul (36) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image052.webp"
  alt="Add class to div and ul in index.html."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Now we've got our markup looking the way that it needs to look for our
project. What's the next thing that we need to do? We did the markup, we
got that all in, so that's great.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 53. step 3, add to head of index.html (36) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image053.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Step 3, directions. Hook up the <b>FlexSlider</b>. This thing says to
use the <b>window.load</b> function. Now, I happen to know that the
<b>window.load</b> function does not work with the latest version of
jQuery, but that's okay. This is what it says down here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 54. update myscript.js (37) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image054.webp"
  alt="Add functions to MyScript.js."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
We could just copy this, <b>window.load</b> function here. This place
after these links, script type JavaScript. But we're going to put this
not inside script tags, but we already have a separate file called
<b>MyScript</b> that's linked up here. That's this one here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 55. on load, run flexslider function (37) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image055.webp"
  alt="MyScript.js: Add flexslider function."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
I'm going to put it on there, <b>MyScript</b>. Take <b>FlexSlider</b>
and make it run. This says jQuery, go get this <b>FlexSlider</b>
element, dot <b>FlexSlider</b>. Remember, we put that class on the
<b>FlexSlider</b> and run the <b>FlexSlider</b> function here. Now, this
function exists because we have the plug-in. The plug-in is defining
this function. This is in addition to jQuery and it wouldn't exist
otherwise. We're putting it inside window load because we want to make
sure all the images offloaded before we can actually start making the
slider run. So, we want to make that happen first. But I happen to know
that this isn't going to work because the <b>window.load</b> function is
deprecated and they want us to use <b>window.on</b> instead. But let's
just test it anyway.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 56/57. example test, verify jquery version # (38) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%"
  alt="Inspect jQuery and FlexSlider code." />
</p>
If I come over here and refresh this page, you'll notice the FlexSlider
is not here. If I do inspect and then come over to the console, index
self is not a function. If you're seeing this stuff where the problem is
actually in the jQuery library, <b>jquery.min.js:2</b>, function load,
this is a really good indicator that something's wrong with jQuery
itself. It's not anything we did. It's actually jQuery. What's wrong
here is that the latest version of jQuery does not support this file.

</p>
Now, if I were to go back to my hosted libraries and take this one
instead, and come back here and replace it, you'll see that it'll work
if I put this up here instead of the newest version. When I put that in
there, put my defer back in, and now if I go test the page, you'll see
that it works. Close this, refresh.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

</p>
Look at that, we have a kitten slider, and it's working, I get my
errors, I get these buttons down here, so I've got this additional
functionality, and it's working. It's doing everything it's supposed to
do.

</p>
But what if I really want to have the latest version of jQuery? Well,
this is where knowing a little bit of JavaScript and a little bit of
jQuery really helps, because I know that this load method here has been
replaced. It's been deprecated. You could go look that up on the jQuery
website if you wanted to.

</p>
Over here instead of load I'm going to use on, and in here, I'm going to
put on load as an event and then run the function and watch this. That
should work. Make sure both files are saved, come back and refresh and
look at that, it works fine using the on method, the more up-to-date
method.

</p>
<p>Okay, great. Now, while we're here, let me just do one other thing.
Suppose I forgot something. This is the thing that is often forgotten
here is what if I forgot to include this fonts folder in my files? I'm
going to move that to the trash. Come back here and refresh this. Use
these boxes instead of the arrows.</p>
That's what that fonts thing is actually doing. It's just providing the
fonts there. Could you do something other than those arrows? Yes, you
can. You can customize the slider so it doesn't use those arrows. But
for right now, let's just leave it at the default, which means I want to
leave these arrows, that fonts folder back over there because the script
is making use of that in order to put those arrows on the page. There
they are, they're back again. Okay, great. We've got the basic slider
working, now we can talk about what else we need to do with it and we'll
do that in the next lesson.

</p>
<p>For example, why is my Flexslider sticking out on the edge over here?
What's up with this gap? What if I wanted to change the color of these
dots down here? These are things that I can adjust if I start poking
around in the CSS. If I right click on this and choose "Inspect", I'll
get my inspector up over here and I can actually see if I come in here
to "My Class" Flexslider here that it's got some margin on it here.
Let's see what else does it have here?</p>
<p>If we want to adjust the border, we can make a rule on our own style
sheet that attaches to dot Flexslider. We don't want to adjust their
style sheet. If I wanted to get rid of that border, I could go poking
around in these files for the jQuery Flexslider CSS. That's the actual
minimized file. There was the Flexslider CSS. I could go poking around
in here and see if I can make changes here, but I don't want to do that
because if I ever update this slider script to a newer version, I don't
want to lose any changes that I've made. This is one of the main reasons
why I want to make sure that my CSS file loads after their CSS file
because if I can add a rule on my CSS file that says dot Flexslider,
then I can override the rule over here.</p>
I want to rule for dot Flexslider, I want to set the margin to this zero
20 pixels. Zero on the top and bottom, 20 pixels in the left and right,
border none, border radius zero. That will clear out some of those
styles and clean-up the styling of the actual Flexslider. Let's add that
to ours. How do I know that? Just by poking around in their CSS file. I
want to make sure I'm on my CSS file.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 75/76. media queries, flexslider styles (44) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%"
  alt="Test, example styles." />
</p>
Then somewhere in here you can put it wherever you want, it doesn't
really matter. Make sure it goes above the media queries. I'm going to
make a comment here that says, "Flexslider styles" and in here I can
make a real dot Flexslider. Margin I want it zero in the top and bottom
and 20 pixels in left and right, I want <b>border;none</b>. No border at
all and border radius zero to give it square edges. Just with that one
rule in place here, if I come back and check my page, you'll notice the
Flexslider looks better here. It's fitting into the space well, and I've
got rid of that gap and all that stuff.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Inspect example site: Kittens For Sale."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"

</p>
Down here, I still want to adjust these buttons a little bit. I mean,
inspect again. Maybe move my inspector to the side and it's this thing
here, dot flex-control-paging li a.flex-active. That's the class that's
changing the colors on these buttons here. That's the one that I want to
actually attach to.

  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
I'm going to come over here, I'm going to add that rule in here. If I
want a different color, what did I put on my slides over here? I put
pound B40205, make it match that. What was it? Just color or is it
background? Background: #B40205. There we go. That will give me a red
background color. Save that and come back and test it.

</p>
You can see my colors now overriding the color that was there before and
I can go ahead and click on these things and they all work. That's
great. You want to put styling on your own style sheet that will
override styles on the Flexslider's CSS to customize it, to make it look
the way you want it to look. Finding out what those styles are, or just
a matter of using the inspector and hunting around to see what rules are
being applied that you might want to change to get it to style and look
the way you want it to look on your page.

It's functional and it looks good and we've adjusted the CSS and all
that kind of fun stuff. That's really great. It's a lot easier to do
this with just a few lines of code, than having to write all of this
functionality ourselves, especially since you've seen how to make a
slider. We didn't include this functionality for being able to have
these buttons down here, being able to go to slides that way. We could
have done that manually on our own, but with this plug in, it provides
it for us automatically and that's great.

</p>
Now, what about all these additional options that show up down here at
the bottom of the screen? There's all this stuff down here, and we can
use this to further customize the functionality of our FlexSlider.
That's really cool, but how do you do it? It's not really clear by
looking at this exactly what you need to do.

<img src="./images/webp/image084.webp"
  alt="FlexSlider Options, default values."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
But basically, what we need to do is we need to pass options in to this
FlexSlider method here, this FlexSlider method here. We pass them in in
the form of an object because these things here are look like key value
pairs that you can pass into an object. It would be really nice if they
made it really clear on exactly how to do this here on the instructions,
but if you know some JavaScript and you're familiar with having done
this kind of thing before, you'll figure it out pretty quickly. What can
we do? Let's take a look at it.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 85. flexslider with options (48) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image085.webp"
  alt="FlexSlider with Options."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Just like we did with the custom enemy method in jQuery, where we can
pass in an object, curly brace, curly brace, and then we can pass in
these key value pairs to get the slider to do some different things.
Let's give that a try. I know we haven't really talked a lot about
objects yet, and we will get into that in more depth in a lesson coming
up. For right now, we'll just kind of go with it and get used to the
syntax because we'll see it a lot, especially with the plugins.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 86/87. update flexslider options (48) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image086.webp?raw=true"

<img src="./images/webp/image087.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Example, using FlexSlider." />
</p>
<p>Let's come over here and inside our script file here, inside our
parentheses here, we're going to add a set of curly braces. Then inside
these curly braces, we can add different settings. What are the settings
that we can add? Well, there are these settings over here. For example,
if you wanted to do animations slide you can set it here, set your
animation fade or slide. By default, it's doing fade. Over here, when we
go from slide to slide, it's fading from slide to slide. It's doing a
fade in fade out. But if we wanted to actually do a slide, we can change
that to animation slide. You can take this, copy it, and then come over
to your script and stick this in here, and change this to slide. Get rid
of the comma, because we only have the one here. If I do that, you'll
notice over here immediately.</p>
Refresh, when I click on the next thing, instead of fading it's sliding.
Look at that, it loops around. You don't have to do any special
programming for that, it's all built right into the plug in. You
remember what a trouble that was for us to figure out how to do
manually. Well, here it's built in, so we don't have to really even
worry about that.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 88/89. other flexslider options (49) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image088.webp?raw=true"

<img src="./images/webp/image089.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="myscript.js. Set animation: 'slide' and slideshowSpeed: 2000." />
</p>
What else can we do? Over here, I had slide, you can set the speed,
slideshow speed. That's in here. Slideshows speed. Slide, comma, for
each one of these in here, you have to put a comma at the end, except
for the last one. I'm not going to set it to seven seconds that would be
really long. I'm going to set it to two seconds. That will tell us how
quickly it's going to slide from slide to slide automatically. One two,
one two, there we go. Now it's going rather quickly, that's great.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 90/91. scroll direction: 'vertical' (50) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">

  alt="Set scroll direction vertical." />    
<img src="./images/webp/image091.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Example, verify scroll direction vertical." />
</p>
What else can we do? We could do direction vertical, if you wanted to
just slide up and down instead, we could do that. Comma, direction,
vertical. This has to go in quotes because it's a word that JavaScript
doesn't know, but it knows that one there. It knows what 2,000 is. All
right, now if you do this, after two seconds, it's going to go vertical.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 92. example, test vertical scroll (50) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image092.webp"
  alt="Example, test vertical scroll."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
We could do reverse true, so we'll go from top to bottom instead of from
bottom to top. Reverse true. True is a word that JavaScript knows. Now
it's going from the top to the bottom.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 93. set pauseonhover = true (51) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image093.webp"
  alt="pauseonHover: true."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>Then finally, another one we could do is pause on hover true. Which
is in here, you can find it in here somewhere pause on hover. There it
is. We had set this, this is a feature that we had tried to build into
our own version, that we did build into our own version. That's true,
and when you're hovering over the slides, they'll stop.</p>
<p>It's very nice interface on it, right? Now every two seconds, it's
going to go unless I hover over the slides, in which case it's going to
stop. It won't because I want to enjoy these kittens, I want to look at
them for a while, two seconds isn't really long enough, so I can really
enjoy them and look at them for as long as I want. Then, when I stop
hovering on it, and I'll wait two seconds and it'll start going again.
That functionality is built in as well. That's great.</p>
It gives us a lot of opportunity to build in a lot of extra
functionality through these additional features that are here. There's a
lot of them. Manual controls, controls container. You can do all kinds
of things. There are arrows. You could swap those arrows out for
something else, so that it doesn't look like every Website you go to has
FlexSlider on it. It could look the same, because they all have the same
arrows here, left and right arrows. We can get rid of those and do
something else that would be kind of interesting and fun.

</p>
Now that you've created the basic FlexSlider, with some advanced
options, we can really do some different things with this FlexSlider.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 95/96. copy flexslider/rename to kittensadvanced (52) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image095.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Copy and rename advancedFlexSlider to KittensAdvanced." />    
<img src="./images/webp/image096.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Copy, rename and verify new folder for FlexSlider changes." />
</p>
<p>To do that, it's nice to keep the basic version working the way it is
working, so that you have a version of that if you want to refer back to
it. If you want to, you can duplicate that folder and create a new
folder and change the name to something like KittensAdvanced, or
something like that. You can see over here; I have actually changed mine
here. I don't need that folder anymore, close that one, but I just
duplicated and called it advancedSlider.</p>
This set of files is currently exactly the same as that set of files.
But I've made a copy so that I have this version if I want to refer back
to it, but I'm essentially done with it. Now I'm only going to work on
the advancedSlider version here. I have that version; these files open
in my code editor.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 97/98. verify right set of files (53) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image097.webp?raw=true"

<img src="./images/webp/image098.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Verify your working with the right set of files." />
</p>
I've also switched this over here so that it's pointing to my
advancedSlider folder here (see top of image), so that I know that I'm
working with the right set of files. Make sure you're working with the
right set of files in your browser. Make sure you've got the right set
of files in your code editor. Over here you can see it says
advancedSlider there, so this is my advanced slider files.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 99. update the markup (53) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image099.webp"
  alt="Update the Markup."
  style="border: 2px solid gray;"
  width="40%;" />
</p>
Great. Now that I've got that into place and I'm ready to really do some
different things with this FlexSlider, the first thing I want to do is,
I want to have a fancier version where, I actually have some content on
top of each slide. Like we did with the JavaScript version of the
slider, where we had a div on top with the heading and a paragraph in
there. Then these slides, the actual pictures, were background images on
the slides. I'm also going to have an animated Call the Action button,
that will drop down and make it really clear that, what you should do is
adopt one of these kittens on this lovely Kitten page. I need to update
the markup to go along with this, for my FlexSlider. I will provide some
snippets with this lesson that you can open and they look like this.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 100. flexslider jquery plugin (54) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image100.webp"
  alt="FlexSlider jQuery Plugin."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
There are some snippets here and so I'm basically going to replace my
slider with this content here. You can type it all out if you wanted to,
instead of just putting the pictures in.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 101. updated markup adding anchor tags (54) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image101.webp"
  alt="Add anchor tags with class to markup."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
I have a div, with an h2. The div has a class of slide 1, slide 2, slide
3, so on and so forth. Then I have the h1 and the h2 and I have an
anchor tag with the class of CTA for ‘Call to Action’. A spin around the
text, which I explain what that's going to do in a few minutes, that
says these kittens are available now. This is going to be like a ‘Call
to Action’ button that you can click on to access these kittens. It's
not really going anywhere because the link is just set to a pound sign.
But if this is a real website, that could be a link to a page where you
could actually adopt this kitten or something like that, that will be
fun. But rather than make you type all of this stuff out, which is
tedious, you can actually come to the snippet page and just copy it.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 102/103. flexslider, slides, class (55) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image102.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Update index.html with FlexSlider, slides and new class (cta)." />
    <img src="./images/webp/image103.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Update index.html with FlexSlider, slides and new class (cta)." />
</p>
<p>Then come back to your project and on your index file, in place of
the slider down here, this FlexSlider, we're just going to paste this
one in instead. Paste that in and it's still div class backsliders,
still your old class slides. All that's changed is the list items in
here.</p>
These divs have a class of slide1, slide 2, slide 3, slide 4 and slide
5. I dump slide 6 and 7 for now, probably five kittens is enough for
this slider and that's great. That gets us started and on our way with
creating our fancier version of our FlexSlider. In the next lesson,
we'll start looking at what we need to do to adjust the styling for
this.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="40%;" />
</p>
In the last module, we updated the markup for our fancy version of the
slider, and now we need to do some updating for the actual CSS for the
display of the slides.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 105/106. styling for flexslider (56) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="./images/webp/image105.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Rules for flexslider." />    
<img src="./images/webp/image106.webp?raw=true"
  style="width:45%"
  alt="Update styles.css with new rules." />
</p>
So, I'm going to come back over here to my snippets and I'm just going
to copy these three rules here. And I'm going to come over and paste
them into my CSS file over here, styles.css. And I'm going to stick them
just in my section with the flex slider stuff here. It doesn't really
matter where they go, I'm going to put them here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 107. styles.css: slide1-slide5 background (57) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image107.webp"
  alt="Define background for slide1 thru slide5 in styles.css."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>Now, this is really important, the slides the .slide1, .slide2,
.slide3, that corresponds to these divs, div class slide3, slide4.
They're going to get a background image. Each one is going to get a
different background image, the background image is positioned at the
top left and said not to repeat.</p>
One thing that's important about this particular slider that you have to
remember is that it's flexible, that's why it's called flex slider. And
it will work for responsive websites and you can make these slides
bigger or smaller. So, we have to pay attention to the proportions of
the slides, from their horizontal width to their vertical height. What
is the proportion there? We want to keep the slides in proportion so
that if they resize on the screen, they resize proportionally. And
keeping track of proportions is a little bit tricky in CSS currently,
there's some features coming to CSS that will make it easier in the long
run, but for right now it's a little clunky and unfortunate.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 108. set position of slides (58) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image108.webp"
  alt="The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>But basically, what I've done here is I've said the div that's inside
these list items, I'm going to make it a width 100% position relative
because I'm going to absolutely position some stuff inside of it. And I
set the padding on the bottom to 50%, and it could be either padding top
or padding bottom and background size cover. And essentially the height
of these, and I probably should add in here, height 0.</p>
Because the height is 0 but the padding on the bottom is 50%. These
images happen to be twice as wide as they are tall. And that's why the
padding is bottom 50%. In this case the padding is relative to the
width. So as wide as these things are, they will always be 50% as high.
And these images are twice as wide as they are tall. So that actually
works for these particular images.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 109. kitten01.jpg image dimensions (59) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image110.webp"
  alt="Image Dimensions for kitten01.jpg."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>If I come back to the finder and look at these images, if I do CMD+I,
you can see here that the dimensions of this image is 960 by 480, it's
twice as wide as it is tall. But what if that were not the case?</p>
<p>What if you had images that had a different ratio? You want to make
sure all your images are the same size, but they might have a different
ratio of height to width, and how do you find out what that is? One easy
way of doing it is to open the image in Photoshop, if you have access to
Photoshop. Or if you don't have access to Photoshop, you could use
another image editor like GIMP is a good image editor that's free for
Mac or Windows or Linux.</p>
But I can go in and find out here what this image size is. And if I want
to find out what the ratio is, if I change this width to 100, notice
that the height is 50. So that means the height is 50% of my width.
Which means I need to set that margin top or margin bottom to 50%.
Setting it to 100 doesn't give you a lot of resolution, but if you set
it to 1000 it would be 50.0%, in this case it's exactly 50%. But if you
had a different ratio for images, you might have 67.25 or something like
that for the height to the width ratio. So that's a good place to find
out what that ratio is. So that you would set the ratio By Photoshop.
And you can set the width to whatever the height is in relation to the
width. And then I've got background size cover.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 110. styling the cta 'call to action' (60) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image110.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Then down here I'm setting the H2 to position absolute top 20 pixels,
left 20 pixels, then I'm setting the color for that. So that's not too
fancy. But that's an important thing to understand with the way that
this is working.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 111. styling the cta 'call to action' (60) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image111.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
The next thing we need is the styling for the actual call to action
buttons that are going to show up on the slides. If I save this like
this, you'll see if I come back and test it, it's fine, but the
call-to-action buttons won't work very well here. So, there's my
call-to-action button there and I need to fix that, but you can see that
the background images have come in. These images are now in the
background of my slide, rather than in the foreground. And the
foreground is an H2 that's been absolutely positioned here. But now I
need to style this call to action, and I'll do that in the next lesson.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch1-13">

  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="40%;" />
</p>
Now we're down to styling the call to action so that it displays
properly on the page, and I have a rule for the dot CTA anchor tags,
there's a lot of stuff in here, but you'll see why as we move forward
and do this, but let's go ahead and add this rule to our style sheet.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 113. styling the call to action (61) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

<p align="center">

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Call to Action Styling." />
<img src="./images/webp/image115.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Styles.css for Call to Action." />
</p>
<p>If you come over here, you can see that I have it here, it's a long
one so, I made it, so you don't have to tighten it, you can just copy
and paste it. I'll explain more about exactly why all these decorations
are in here, but for right now, let's just added in over here.</p>
<p>A few things to look at, it's set to display flex for the call to
action, and that's making this anchor tag display flex, so that this
element class of the span in here can get positioned in the vertical
center. By setting that to display flex and align-item center, that will
allow me to put that text in the vertical center of these called
actions, these called actions are going to be round buttons, and I want
the text to be in the vertical and horizontal center, so that allows us
to do that. I'm just setting the height and the width to 25vw, which is
viewport width, 25 percent of the viewport width, so these buttons will
scale up and down with the size of the window, and you'll see that this
is actually too large for the desktop, we will put in a rule down in the
media queries to fix that in a minute.</p>
<p>I'm also setting position absolute on these, because they're going to
be absolute positioned from the right, and then bottom 100 percent means
they're going to be positioned initially off the top of the screen. I'm
setting bottom 100 percent that's going to push the bottoms of these up
to 100 percent, the height of that parent element, and that's going to
put them all the way off the top of the screen.</p>
When we come to the slide, they're going to animate down into the
screen, you'll see in a minute as we finish this up. I'm setting a
background color, border radius 50 percent is what makes them round, I'm
putting a border on them with the color, and then text-align center,
puts the text in the horizontal center, some padding, text-decoration,
none gets rid of the underlying setting, the font family, the font size,
4vw is four percent of the viewport width, so again, the font it's going
to resize based on how wide the screen is, and then also the color for
the text. That's a lot of stuff.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 116/117. define class: light (63) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image116.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Styles.css: Define new class .light." />
<img src="./images/webp/image117.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Utilize class: light in index." />
</p>
We're going to do one more rule in here for dot light (.light), and I'm
setting a color in here, color, and I think I set it to, where did I set
it to #ededed. The reason for that, it's a light gray, one of the slides
is dark, so over here, I have a class of light on slide 4.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 118. styles.css: background slide (63) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image118.webp"
  alt="Define different background colors for slides."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>You may have also wondered why on one of the slides I went up here, I
went kitten 2 to kitten 6, and then four, and then five. Kitten 3, the
colors on that one just don't work well with the colors for the text, so
I swapped it to one of the other ones.</p>
But for number 4 here, I wanted to make this text light, so, I put a
different color in there and a different class for that one, that's all
we need there for that, so that's really good and should make sense in
our work.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 119. resize call to action button (64) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image119.webp"
  alt="Resize the CTA (call to action) button for tablet-sized browser windows."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
We need a couple more rules that are going to resize these elements for
desktop and for mobile, so we need to add these rules into the media
queries at the bottom of the style sheet (styles.css), and we're just
setting height, width, and font size.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 120/121. tablet-sized min-width: 600px (64) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image120.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="styles.css: min-width: 600px." />
<img src="./images/webp/image121.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="CTA: Call To Action anchor tag." />
</p>
For the tablet-sized versions of the site, which is, screens that are
600 pixels and wider, I'm just going to set dot CTA with 20vw instead of
25, and height, same height, height 20vw. Because up here, it's setting
it to 25, and that's going to get too large as my screen gets larger, so
I'm going to just shrink it down just a little bit there, and then I'm
setting the font size to a little bit smaller, I think is not what it
was, yes, 3vw instead of 4vw, it's 3vw, and so bringing the font size
down a little bit, 3vw.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 122/123. desktop with min-width: 1000px (65) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image122.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="styles.css: min-width: 1000px." />
<img src="./images/webp/image123.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="styles.css: new ID cta with width/height of 150px." />
</p>
Then, when we get to the full-screen size for desktop, I need this
again, and I'm just going to set it to a maximum size, because at this
point the screen isn’t going to be flexible anymore, so I want these to
be set to a specific size, 150px, so it's not going to be flexible
anymore, because if, this size or wider, it's always going to be this
size, 150px. Font-size to 24 pixels.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 124. kittens for sale example (65) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image124.webp"
  alt="Kittens for Sale example."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
That gets all of the styling in place for these, and if we go back and
review the page, you'll see that the call to action isn't on the screen
at all, it's going to be up here, I actually noticed down here at bottom
100 percent, so it is showing up. But this is the way they're going to
look in end here, is round like this.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 125. example: kittens for sale! (66) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image125.webp"
  alt="Kittens for Sale example, #2."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>If you go to number 4, slide 4, that one should be picking up the
light class, and I don't know why it's not now. You know what, I think I
put it on the wrong one. Let's fix that. Over here. Cut it from there
and stick it on this one. That seems like it should be the right one.
It's so cute, it's that one. I think they're just #ededed, it should be
right. It may need to be refreshed properly, but that's okay. Great, so
you got that all in place. The last thing we need to do is get this
animation to work.</p>

</p>
<p>Hello and welcome to our second module. In this lesson, we will look
at scroll effects. Scroll effects are very popular these days and you
see them a lot around the Web. Plus, we'll work on a project that will
allow you to test your skills by bringing together, a lot of the scripts
we've created so far, all together in one page. And that's a great way
to test your skills, and see how you're doing with this.</p>
Let's dive in, break out our code editors and our web browsers, and get
started on this module.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch2-02">
2.02. Introduction to Smooth Scroll with jQuery (4:15)

  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="40%;" />
</p>
In the first part of this lesson, we're going to use jQuery to make a
smooth scroll script so that when you click a link at the top of the
page, it does a smooth scrolling action further down the page.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 128/129. section one and two example (68) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Example section one." /> <img src="./images/webp/image129.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Example section two." />
</p>
<p>And I have an example page that you can download with example files
and I have them open here and you'll notice if I click section one, it
puts section one right at the top of the window.</p>
Currently this is just a scrolling page with a bunch of sections on
here. And this is just basic html. If I click section two it just put
section two at the top of the page, you can see here the URL has pounds
second in here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 130/131. section links defined (68) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image131.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Example sections 1st thru 5th." />
</p>
<p>If I go into my files and look at this, you can see that my links are
just linked to these IDs pound first links to section ID first and pound
second links to section links to the ID second down here, so on and so
forth. And that's just basic HTML. But it doesn't provide a very good
user experience because when you click on something it just pops to that
section and you don't get the sense of it actually traveling there.</p>
<p>An interface element that's been popular for a long time now is to
create a smooth scroll effect so that you can get the sense of traveling
from one place to another place on a web page. And if it happens
smoothly and quickly without a lot of interference, then it adds to the
user experience. So, we're going to do that using jQuery.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p align="center">

  alt="Smooth Scroller example with set heading."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" /></p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is set the header so its position
fixed. And if you go back to the files, you'll notice in the style sheet
up here at the top, I have position fixed commented out. If you remove
that comment and save it and then come back and refresh the page, you'll
notice that now the header is fixed to the top of the window and the
section one has now bumped up to the top of the window. And that's
because the header has now been taken out of the normal flow of the
document.</p>
When you set something to position fixed, it's no longer part of the
normal flow of the document and the document will ignore it because the
top is set to zero and the left to set to zero. This header is now
pinned to the top left position of the view port here. And it's set to
width 100% so it will stretch across the entire window. Now you can see
because it's slightly transparent that the images and every all the
content is passing beneath this header.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image136.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Smooth Scroller example of padding-top: 200." />
</p>
<p>But you also notice that it's covering up part of section one. So, we
need to go back to our style sheet here and uncomment out this line
here, remove that comment to set the padding on the body to top 200
pixels. And that will push that first section down and we need to do
that because the header is no longer part of the normal flow of the
document. So, we need to push that first section down, hopes to get
saved. When you refresh it doesn't necessarily put the page at the top
of the window. But now you can see when I load the page fresh, it is
loading it with 200 pixels padding, which allows this element here to be
sitting below the header. But the headers out of the normal flow of the
document. Okay, so with some basic CSS and some basic HTML out of the
way, we can start working on our script and getting the interactivity to
work properly.</p>

</p>
We have set up our files, and we're ready to start working on our
script, and you'll notice down here at the bottom of the page, I have
jQuery linked to a slightly older version of the library. You could hook
up the 3.6 version here instead if you wanted to, and I have the
<b>easing</b> plugged in because we're going to make use of that as
well. You're already familiar with that from a previous lesson. If
you've forgotten, you can go back to the previous lessons and review the
easing plug-in and how that works. Then I have linked here a file called
<b>smoothscroll.js,</b> which is our JavaScript file, and this is where
we're going to write our jQuery code.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 139/140. add click handler to index (71) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

<img src="./images/webp/image140.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="smoothscroll.js - click handler function." />
</p>
I'm going to remove that comment, and add here a click handler, so I'm
going to use my jQuery object to come in and grab my <b>nav ul li a</b>,
the anchor tags in the navigation over here at these anchor tags that I
want to get from up here at the top of the page, <b>nav, ul, li, a</b>.
If you had another nav element on the page, you might give this an ID,
so that you would target this very specifically with an ID to get to
these anchor tags, but this page just has one nav element, so this is
specific enough for this particular page. But I'm going to add a click
handler and then, we pass in our function that runs when the element is
clicked. Then, I want to make a variable that's going to hold the link
that's clicked. This click handler will be applied to all of the anchor
tags, but you can only click on one of them at a time, so we need to
know which one was clicked. I'm going to make a variable, var
thisSection, you could use const as well if you preferred, but I'm just
going to make var thisSection, and assign it this.attr(href). What
that'll do is it'll get the href of the link that was clicked. Let's
alert that out. You can see what it actually does.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 141. example: alert, click handler (72) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Example: alert click handler function."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"

</p>
If I come back to my HTML, I've put a click handler on all of these
anchor tags here, but you can only click on one at a time. I should be
getting pound 1st, pound, 2nd, pound 3rd, pound 4rth, and 5th, and I
need that href because I need to know which one of these sections I'm
going to. It's the ID. It matches the idea of the section. If I come
back over here, and refresh the page and click one of these links, I
should get pound 1st, pound 2nd, pound 3rd, pound 4th, and pound 5th.
You'll notice it is actually moving the page there as well as it does
that, but I want to make sure I'm getting those links.

<img src="./images/webp/image142.webp"
  alt="HTML stop animate."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"

</p>
<p>Let's go back to our script. Now, we don't need this alert here at
all. That's not going to help anything, but it just shows us what's
going on here. But now, I need to tell my page. I'm going to come in
here. I'm going to say get the HTML element, and I'm going to use the
stop method, and I'll explain what that does in a minute.</p>
The best way to explain it is to see it, so for right now, just put it
in. Then we're going to use our custom animate method, and we're going
to pass in an object here that's going to add animation here. We'll do
that, and we'll see, how long is it going to run? We're going to do it
over 800 milliseconds. That gives us a sense of what's going on here
when we're going to do that, and we'll test this in a minute. This is
going to actually animate our HTML, and in here, we'll use our
<b>thisSection</b> thing to tell us where we're going to animate to, and
we'll do that in the next lesson so you see how it all comes together.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch2-04">

<img src="./images/webp/image144.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Adding the animation to smoothscroll.js." />
</p>
In the previous module we created a click handler for all the anchor
tags and then we got the ID of the particular anchor tag that gets
clicked on because you can only click one at a time. What is the idea
associated with that or what's the href associated with that? Which
points to the idea of the section down below that we're going to. It's
going to be pound (#) 1st or pound 2nd or pound 3rd or pound 4th or
pound 5<sup>th</sup> (#1st-#5th). We've already seen that.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 144. animate scroll top (74) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image144.webp"
  alt="Animate in 8 tens of a second property of scrollTop."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>Then we're going to animate the html. And I'll show you in a minute
what this stop thing does, but we're going to animate and in here we
pass in a key value pair that we're going to actually animate. What is
that key value pair? We're going to animate over 800 milliseconds here.
The property that we're going to animate is <b>scrollTop</b>. Now, what
is scroll top? Scroll top is an HTML property that you may not be aware
of and it returns or sets the position that an element is going to be
from the top of the window.</p>
When we click on a particular link, we want to put the corresponding
section at the top of the window. So how are we going to do that? We're
going to do it with the offset method. The offset method and we want to
offset top. We'll set it to offset top. So, dollar sign in parentheses,
this section and set its offset, to the top over 800 milliseconds. And
that will actually animate the page to the top of the window.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 145. example: offset scrolltop (75) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image145.webp"
  alt="Example: offset scrollTop."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
If we test this out and if you're wondering what offset is, you can go
look it up on the jQuery documentation and see what offset does and how
it's used. But essentially it allows us to move a particular element to
a particular place on the screen. And where are we moving it to? We're
moving it to the top. Let's see what happens if I'm going to get rid of
the pound second from up here and refresh the page. And then if I click
2nd, you can see that it does a smooth scroll right to with that section
going right up to the top of the window.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 146/147. stop method with example (76) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image146.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Stop method." /> <img src="./images/webp/image147.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Example, scroll stop method." />
</p>
<p>We don’t want it to go all the way to the top of the window, we want
it to stop here and we'll fix that in a minute. But before we do, what
I'd like to point out is what this stop method does. So over here I'm
going to actually set this to a longer period of time. 3000. It's kind
of really long, but I'm going to set it to 3000. And if I come back and
test this again, you'll notice it'll take a long time to go to the
section three, four seconds. But you'll notice if I press section one
and before it goes there, if I press section two it'll stop that
animation and continue on. It will continue on to the next one that I've
started. So I press section five, it starts, but if I do four it'll
actually not finish that first animation and go to the fourth section
instead. And that's what this stop method is doing here.</p>
If I take stop out, you'll notice that the animation start to stack. So
now, if I come back here and go back up to the top of the page and click
refresh. If I press 3rd while if I press 4<sup>th</sup> section and then
2nd section and then 4th section, then second section you'll notice that
the animation stack and it's waiting for each animation to complete
before it goes on to the next one. Which is not really the experience
that we want to have. We want it to stop that animation. I clicked on
5th section. And I've changed my mind and I want to go to the 2nd
section. I want it to go there right away without having to wait for it
to go all the way down to the 5th section. So that's what this stop
method is doing for us. Don't stop. So it will stop the animation that's
running and then animate the thing that we've clicked on next.

<img src="./images/webp/image149.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Example: scroll to top minus 200px." />
</p>
Okay, now the next thing is this there are two minor things we need to
fix. First of all, I really want it to move to top minus 200 like so.
Because I really don't want to go all the way to the top of the page. So
that's one. So now if I come back here and test this. Now if I click
section two instead of going all the way up to the top of the page, it
goes to 200 pixels down from the top of the page. Which you'll remember,
we put 200 pixels padding up there. So that's now putting it in the
correct place, so that helps. So that's one thing, I'm going to put this
back to 800 because the animation is so slow now.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 150. move animation tag to body (77) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"

</p>
Okay, the other thing is I'm going to put a comment here and add body.
Now, pretty much these days all the browsers will animate the HTML
element and you won't run into a problem with this, but there have been
in the past certain browsers that won't do that and so you have to
actually put this animation on the body tag instead. Now in fact, it
seems like the most updated versions of Safari and Firefox and Chrome
all handle the HTML just fine. But this is kind of just to fall back
just in case somebody is using an older browser. I'm not sure when they
actually fixed up, so we won't see a difference because of that now, but
it's just something to be aware of, Going forward.

  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"

</p>
The smooth scroll script is working and that's great, but because we
have the easing plugin plugged in, we can give the script a little bit
more personality by adding some easing.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 152/153. script must follow jquery library load (78) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image153.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="index.html scripts." />
</p>
Let's go ahead and do that. Over here, just to verify on our index file
here down at the bottom of the page, you can see I have the jQuery
library loaded and then I have the easing plugin loaded and then my
script comes after that. Always, your script has to come after the
jQuery library and any plugins that you're using.

  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Over here, after my 800, I can add a comma and add an easing and I used
<b>easeOutCirc</b> as my easing here, which gives us a pretty dramatic
set of easing. If I set that and then while I'm here, I'm just going to
put a return in here. That opens and then that closes there. I want to
move that down like so, there we go, <b>easeOutCirc</b>. I think that
looks a little bit better, a little bit easier to read. We animate this
over 800 milliseconds when we are using <b>easeOutCirc</b>.

</p>
Let's go take a look and see how it looks. Now it's got a nice, slightly
snappier feel going to the sections, and if it's still going too slowly
for you, you could reduce the time further. Come over here and set this
to instead of 800 set it to 400. We will cut it in half, see what
happens. You have to find the right setting that you think feels good.
This feels very snappy because they're very quickly, but does it still
give you the sense that you're traveling to that part of the page? Yeah,
it does, so that's nice. Maybe I'll leave it like that.

</p>
<p>This is all working and I could leave the script like this. It's
certainly functioning, but I want to do a little bit more with it. What
I want to do is actually change the highlighting on these links to
indicate which link I'm actually on when I get to that section. Up here,
this becomes an indicator of which section I'm looking at along with
sort of the label on that section. I'm going to do that by adding a
callback function in here.</p>
After the animation completes, I'm going to run a function in here. In
this callback function, I'm going to add an alert and, in the alert, I'm
going to actually alert out the offset, so you can see how far from the
top of the page the element actually is. How far off the top of the
window, really, it's what it is. I'm going to use my jQuery object to go
get the window and see what it offset, is it offset? I think it's like
that offset. We have done that right. Here we go. Let's see if I did
that right. I think I did. I come back here, refresh the page, click
second and I did something wrong there.

On the style sheet is a rule, selected, and I might have it commented
out. Let's go over and see because if we do, we need to uncomment it
out.

</p>
<p>We go to Styles, go down here and it's not commented out, good. I've
got Selected here and it's set to a color, and it's got a one second
transition for transitioning that class there. What we're going to do is
we're going to change the link that we've clicked on, we're going to add
the class, selected, to it. I need to add a variable, this link, and
it's just this, the link that I clicked. The item that I clicked and I
could just use this down here, but I think it's a little bit helpful to
have the variable name. This link is just the thing that I've clicked,
it's this, so let's go ahead and add that. On our smooth scroll script
here at the top, I may add a variable for this link equals dollar sign
this. Down here, we don't really need this alert anymore. I'm just going
to comment it out. I'm going to leave it there in case you want to refer
to it. That scroll type stuff can be a little bit confusing, sometimes
it's helpful to have that in there just to remind yourself what the heck
scroll top is and how that's actually working.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to say this link, dot attr, amazing class name I
figured when I put over there. I'm using add class. We'll use that
method. You could also use the attr method, but I'm going to just use
add class, select it.</p>
<p>Now, there's one small problem here in that this will work the first
time you click on a link, but it won't work every time. We'll see here
as we use this when I click second, it'll add the class, and then when I
click third, it'll add the class, when I click forth, it'll add the
class. It's working, but what I really wanted to do is remove the class
from these, and then just put it on the one that I've clicked so they
don't just all turn pink.</p>
Although you could have an interface that shows which ones if you
clicked on and it would work for that, but I really wanted to just
highlight the one that I've actually clicked on.

</p>
<p>I'm going to go back to my script, and I'm just going to modify just
a little bit here by saying, use my jQuery object to go in here and get
all those anchor tags, nav ul li a. Here I'm going to use attr. Well, I
don't think I'm going to do that, I think I want to do something else. I
want to use actually, I'm going to remove the class attribute. That
removes the class attribute from all of them, and then just adds it to
the one that I've clicked on. Let's see if that works.</p>
<p>Come back here, refresh the page, now when I click on that, it adds
the class there; it removes the class from all of them and then adds it
to the one that I've clicked on. That's working great.</p>
<p>Now, you could go back at the beginning when the page loads, and just
add selected to the class of this element, of this first one here. Let's
do that, just so that when the page loads, we're obviously going to be
up at the top of the page. We might as well have, class equals quote,
selected, on that first link in the navigation, so that now when you
load the page from the start. That comes up live because that's what
we're showing; we're showing Section one, and then we'll go to section
two and it will turn off all of them and then add it there, and that's
working great. With that, part of the script is finished.</p>
<p>We have a script where we can click on it to animate that section,
and highlight the correct section. One thing you'll notice, though, is
that if you scroll the page, it doesn't change what's highlighted up
here, and to do that, we really need to manage this scroll event so that
we can handle what happens as we scroll the page and move from one
section to another. We're going to deal with that in the next
lesson.</p>

In this lesson, we're going to take the files that we already started
here, and this script is working so that if I click on the section it
goes to the correct section and it highlights the correct menu item up
here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

</p>
<p>But what it does not do is if I scroll down the page, it doesn't
change the highlighting to demonstrate the section that I'm looking at
here. This may seem like a little thing, a minor detail, and I suppose
that it is in this page, and we're going to work on a script to fix
this, and it may seem that the script we're creating is awfully
complicated to fix such a small thing. But what's really cool is the
script that we're going to write that will allow us to change the
highlighting based on where we are in the page is capturing the scroll
of that.</p>
Working with scroll scripts can be challenging because there are some
difficulties that you have to deal with. But the really cool thing is
that if we could get these things to highlight, we could do anything on
the page based on where we are, scroll down the page. If you think about
that for a second and go look at some of the interesting websites that
are out there. https://callbruno.com/en
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

</p>
For example, I have one pulled up here, this website here, and as I
scroll down, different things are happening based on whether I'm
scrolling. Scroll down, this happens, scroll up this go back out. This
is capturing the scroll event and doing something on the page based on
whether or not I'm scrolling. So, I scroll down the page here that
animation plays differently while I'm scrolling up or scrolling down.
It's affected by the scroll.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

</p>
Down here there's another one such as switch to white, which switched
based on when and where I was scrolling my scroll up will switch to
black or dark gray. When I get down here, this set of icons is moving
based on whether I'm scrolling or not. If we want to be able to do any
of these types of effects, you need to capture the scroll event, and you
need to be able to do things with that scroll event when you capture it,
and that can be a little bit challenging and we'll get into why in just
a minute here.

</p>
But for right now, for this script, all we're going to do is change the
highlighting on these links, which seems like a very minor thing. But
just keep in mind that when we're done with this script, we will have a
script that you could use on lots of Web pages to track where you are in
the page and do lots of different animations or cool effects or other
things based on where you are on the page. That's pretty exciting.

</p>
By the way, I should add that I don't know anything about this Web site
or this company, I just went to the awards website (awwwards.com) and
picked the first one that showed up over here. This is a good Web site
to come to. I think I've pointed out in previous lessons, if you want to
see some interesting interactions that people have created on the Web,
they often get posted here. This is a good place to come to get
inspiration about different things that you can do.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 171. window load and scroll listener (87) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image171.webp"
  alt="Window Load and Scroll listener."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Let's get started with our script and we're going to work with the same
files that we just completed, you don't need to change anything on them.
We're just going to continue to work on the JavaScript file in that
folder. We're going to start by adding an event handler that waits for
the whole page to be loaded. Again, we don't want anything to happen
until the whole page is loaded with all the images and everything else.
Then we're going to capture the actual scroll with an event handler for
capturing scroll using jQuery. Let's go ahead and add these to our
script here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 172. console.log, scrolling (89) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image172.webp"
  alt="Tag console.log as scrolling to section."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Over here on my <b>smoothscroll</b> page here, I'm just going to go down
here. We've got this script is handling this scroll, and I'm going to
click after that and I'm going to add a jQuery object for window, the
window object onload, we're going to run a function. Again, this
function runs when all of the content of the page is loaded, and in this
case, that's important because one of the things we need to keep track
of is how tall each of these sections are. Well, how tall this section
is has something to do with how large this picture is. If this picture
was in here, the section would take up less space because it would end
here. It wouldn't be that tall.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 173. on load, scroll function (89) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image173.webp"
  alt="On load, scroll function."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>If I want to track which section is on the screen, I need to know how
big the section is. For me to know how big the section is all of the
content has to be loaded, including images, provide videos or other
content. It all has to be loaded before I say, "Well, how tall are you?"
I need to know how tall you are so I can know whether the sections on
the page or not. So that's why I need to make sure I put everything
inside this window on load call back here to make sure that I'm
capturing when the window loads, so that everything I do is inside of
there.</p>
Then I'm going to next add the jQuery object for window, that scroll.
This event will tell us if the page is scrolling at all, as with a peer
review or click handler, we're going to pass in a function that's going
to run when the page scrolls. This function runs when the page scrolls,
and that's where we're going to put our script is inside here as the
page scrolls, and I could just for right now, I could just do alert, I
could do console.log. You don't want to do alert because you'll get a
ton of alerts scrolling, and save that.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 174. test, scrolling (89) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image174.webp"
  alt="Example, test scrolling."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
If I come back to my page now and choose my inspector over your turn on
my console, keep that a little bit narrower and to refresh the page. As
I move it, you'll see this event is firing. It fired 41 times already.
Any time I move just a tiny little bit, that event for scrolling is
fiery. This is one of the really big things that you have to pay
attention to when working with the scroll event, is that it's going to
capture every time you scroll the tiny, tiny little bit. If you're doing
big things on your page, then you have to be careful about overloading
your processor, if you want to move stuff around on the screen, it's
easy to overload it by firing this event so many times and trying to do
too many things at once.

  alt="2.08. The Crux of the Problem."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Now, we're going to get to the crux of the problem. What we're going to
do is we're going to look at a couple of variables and watch what
happens as we scroll on the page.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 176. window scroll event listener code (91) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image176.webp"
  alt="Window scroll event listener code."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>On your page, you want to add some variables here. You want to add
these three variables, and then we're going to set the value of inside
the scroll event. These are outside the scroll event.</p>
Then inside the scroll event, we're going to change post position every
time you scroll the page and change page top, every time we scroll the
page and then we'll just console log these two values out here. Let's
add this to our file over here. I'm just going to piece these variables
and you're going to have to type them, these three variables here. Now
posts is just going into the index page and finding all of the sections.
This is going to be an array that holds five sections over here. That's
going to have post and this is going to have five sections. Then down
here, we need to set the values of these. I'm just going to piece them
in here. I'm going to remove this console log; we don't need that one
anymore and put this in instead.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 177. window scroll event listener code (92) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image177.webp"
  alt="Window scroll event listener code, #1."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
PostPosition is going to go find post zero, the first section on the
page and get its offset top and then page top is going to go get window
scrollTop. Then we're going to console log the two values of these
things out, so we can see what they are. Save that and then come over to
your page and with your console log showing over here, refresh the page
and I'm going to close this down here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 178. window scroll event listener code, #2 (93) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image178.webp"
  alt="Window scroll event listener code, #2."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>I've got something wrong over here. Offset is not a function. Is it
offset with s? It's offset with lower-case s. Make sure you do this
right offset. There we go. Try that again.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 179. example, window scroll listener (93) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image179.webp"
  alt="Example, window scroll listener."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>There we go. I got zero, for the first one and 200 for the second
one. Remember, the first one is pageTop. That's where my Window is. It's
at position zero. My first post is 200 pixels down the page and we knew
that already because when we set up this page in the previous lesson, we
put padding on the top of 200 pixels, which pushes this down. But now,
as I scroll the page, notice that the number on the left changes as I
scroll the page. That's telling me how many pixels above the top of the
screen my pages. But the number on the right does not change. That's the
position of that top section from the top of the page. By using these
two numbers, I can know whether a particular section is on the screen or
not. If I'm scrolled up at the top of the screen and this number here,
it's a zero right now, if that number is less than two hundred, or less
than the height of that element, then I know that element is showing on
the screen. I need to know how tall this section is. But however tall
that section is, I know it's on the screen, if this number here is less
than the number of how tall that section is.</p>
<p>The first piece that we need to know is where does the section start.
It starts at 200. Then I need to know how tall is that section. From
that, I can figure out how much of the page is this section taking up
and where in my page am I in terms of scrolling. That will help me
figure this thing out. It's really important to understand this before
we continue to get what we're going for here, because I need to know
when a particular section is in a particular place on my screen or in my
view port.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 180/181. example, highlight section (94) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image180.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Example, highlight section, #1." />
<img src="./images/webp/image181.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Example, highlight section, #2." />
</p>
<p>The next thing to pay attention to, let me just go up to the top of
the page and refresh the page, is notice when I scroll the page, if I
scroll really quickly and look over here, you'll notice I'm not hitting
every pixel. If I scroll slowly, I'm more likely to hit more of the
pixels. But if I scroll quickly, I might not hit all of the pixels. So,
you can see in here, 2,351 was registered, 2,347 was registered, 2,343
was registered, and then 2,333 was registered. So I'm not hitting every
single pixel.</p>
What's important about that is I can't write a script that says, if your
X number of pixels down the page do something. I can't do that because
while I'm scrolling I might not hit that specific pixel. I might but I
might not. That's another thing to be aware of when writing scripts that
are about the scroll effect or capturing scroll events. Then again, we
want to watch out for performance because this scroll event is firing
every time I scroll a tiny little bit. Those are the two pieces that
make capturing scroll events tricky, the fact that you can't be sure
which pixel you going to hit and you have to watch out for performance.

  alt="2.09. Strategy."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="40%;" />
</p>
Now, the next thing we need to watch out for are what could the user
possibly be doing on the page when it comes to scrolling?
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 183. scroll down or up (if not at top) (96) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image183.webp"
  alt="Scroll down or scroll up (if other than top of page)."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
There's really just two scenarios that we have to pay attention to,
either the users at the top of the page and scrolling down or somewhere
on the page and scrolling down, or there's somewhere further down the
page, and they're scrolling back up towards the top of the page. It's
only one of those two things. They can only scroll up, and they can only
scroll down, and they can only scroll up if they're not at the top.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 184. setting up if/else statement (96) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image184.webp"
  alt="Set up if/else statement for scroll event."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
We're going to use a variable called counter, and then we're going to
have an If statement, and the If statement is going to handle the first
scenario of what happens if we're scrolling down the page. The Else If
is going to handle what happens if we're further down the page and
scrolling up into a previous section. Let's go ahead and add this to our
script over here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 185. add if/else code for scroll (97) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  alt="Add if/else code for scroll."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
I'm going to add a new variable here called Counter for your counter. I
will set it to zero. Then down here inside my script, I can get rid of
these things, for now, I don't really need them. Instead, what I want to
put here is an If statement if and Else If like so. This one's going to
handle the situation of, am I scrolling down? I'm going to select that
and comment it, and we're scrolling down and this one's going to handle
the case of, am I scrolling up. These are the two scenarios that we need
to watch out for. We've got our basic structure of what's going to
happen to handle these two situations of what happens while we're
scrolling down and what happens when we're scrolling up.

  alt="Identify size of each section element."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"

</p>
<p>The next thing that we need is we need to know how many pixels down
are all of the post tops of this for each post. We've got all of these
posts here, we've captured them, which are really our section elements.
We put them in posts, but we want to know where the tops of each of
those sections are. I'm going to make one more variable here for post
tops. I'm going to assign it an empty array for now like so. Then what I
want to do is I want to use a Jacoway method called each to push into
this array the post top position.</p>
<p>A few minutes ago, we did in here, we had the thing getting the
position of the first post. Now we want to get the position of all the
posts or all the sections, each section. We want to get the position of
each section on the page. We want to find out how far down the page each
section is. The first section is 200 pixels down. We saw that just a
minute ago.</p>
But now I need to know where are the rest of them and going to put them
into this array. I'm going to paste this in. You're going to have to
type it, but I'm going to post it in here, paste and posts. I'm going to
use the each method.

</p>
In plain JavaScript, we have for each but in jQuery, we have in each
method that we can pass in a function. I'm going to push the tops and I
have a <b>Math.floor</b> and you'll let me take that out just for a
minute. I'll take math for it now because that kind of confuses things.

</p>
Put this in here for a moment, posts each function, post up push. This
offset top, this refers to the post that's getting pushed in. This is
going to go through each one of these posts up here. For each one of
them, it's going to take this one to one that it's on and put its offset
top and push it into the array post tops. If I just cancel log outpost.
Tops. That array, it'll give us a number for where each one of these
elements is. Make sure you type this in. You can pause this lesson and
get this typed in because it's really important to see this. We're going
to need this for the rest of our script here. But if I do that and then
come back to my page and just click refresh. Unexpected token when I
took out. The math thing, I screwed it up tonight. Push this set too,
looks great to me.

<p>If I come back to the page and refresh the page, you'll see here I
get an array with five elements in it for each of my five sections, 200,
700, 1500.6875, and then 21 no 4.56- and 2683.4875. I don't really need
all the decimal points, so that's why I put the <b>Math.floor</b> in
there.</p>

thing. This offset top here and put it into the floor method so that it
rounds it down. If I save that and then come back and refresh again, now
I'm just getting whole numbers 200, 700, 1525, 2104, and 2683 and that's
good. Great. We'll pick it up in the next lesson.</p>

to add this statement here, page top (<b>pagetop</b>), which is this
variable up here that we created but have not assigned. We looked at it
before and we just set it to window scroll top. Here I'm going to set it
to window scrollTop plus 210. That's because we know our page over here.

</p>
<p>The first section starts 200 pixels down. I'm going to mark it 200
pixels down, plus a tiny bit more, an extra 10 pixels about there. That
will tell me how far down that page is, or really how far from the top
of the window the section is. Then, in the IF statement I'm going to
check to see if page top is greater than postTops, square bracket,
counter plus 1. Remember, postTops has an array with all of the elements
in the array. The counter starts at zero. Our first section was at 200
pixels. If this page top is going to be greater than not counter 0, but
counter 1, which would be over here if we look at this, if that thing
that's saying how far we're scrolling down the page is greater than 700,
then this second section must be up here, must be up towards the top of
the page if that number is greater than that number.</p>

<p>What I want to do here is, okay, when I get into that place and want
to increment the counter, counter plus plus then I may just console log
out. Console dot log, something like tick marks. Counter is now $ curly
brace counter, something like that or maybe just scrolling down. Let's
do that, scrolling down, counter. Something like that. That should be
cool I think. We can't do anything with this yet. I'm going to take this
out and just comment the else if for the moment. Like that to there and
commented out so it doesn't cause a problem.</p>

</p>
<p>But now while we're scrolling down, the counters should get
incremented when we go into the next section. Also, you want to either
comment this one out or get rid of it. Actually, maybe I'll leave it
there. That's fine. I'll leave that there for a moment and then come
back here and I'm going to refresh the page. There's my array, and when
I get down to the next section scrolling down, the counter is now one.
When I get down to the next section, scrolling down the counter is now
two. Scrolling down the counter is now three. As soon as the section
comes up here and it's zero-indexed, so section five, the counter is set
to four. In section one, the counter is set to zero. Scrolling up won't
get me anything yet, but scrolling down should get me the right number.
It gets a little bit screwed up because we need to fix the else if. But
you can see that it's working initially when we scroll down.</p>
<p>As we get past each one of these numbers, it's reporting that the top
of the section is 210 pixels from the top of the page which is what I
want to know. What's really cool about this is that even though the
scroll event is capturing every little smidgen that I scroll the page,
every little tiny bit, I'm actually going to only do something when the
new section comes into place. That makes the script efficient because I
don't have to do something every tiny little bit that I scroll. I only
have to do something when the section hits the certain part of the page
place on the window. That's one of the things that makes this script
very efficient and very useful and helps address one of the gotchas with
working with scroll events, which is that you have to be careful not to
do something every time you scroll a tiny little bit because you can
overload your CPU.</p>

<p>It's not uncommon that out. I'm first going to check to see if
counter is greater than zero because I would want this else if to take
place and this is why it's an an else if and not announce, but I only
wanted to take place if the counter is greater than zero. And remember
the counter is only going to be greater than zero if we have scroll down
into the second section or the third section or the fourth section,
because the counter only gets implemented when we scroll down into those
sections, so if the counter is greater than that and ampersand ampersand
Yeah. PostTops, PageTops is less than PostTops, square bracket counter
this value, PageTop, this value here, which changes as you scroll the
page every little bit if it's less than the PostTops counter.</p>

</p>
<p>So like suppose we were down at the bottom of the page and counter
was set to four for the last section number five. So that would go into
the array and get that last number which is the 2000 whatever number of
pixels for that thing there. Okay, so if I go get that number and this
number is less than that number then I must be scrolling up the page. In
which case I then want to detriment counter, counter minus minus. And
then I'm going to do a console log scrolling up and then the counter
we'll see what the counter is. All right, let's go and see what this
does. I think that hopefully I did that right? I think I did.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Example, scroll up/down." />
</p>
<p>So now if I come back and refresh this page we're at the top of the
page if I scroll down into section two you can see scroll down, this
becomes a one because we're zero indexed. We scroll down again, now
we're at two for section three, we're three for section four, four for
section five. But if I scroll up, you'll see scrolling up. Now we're
coming into section three and then two and then one? So our numbers were
either scrolling down or were scrolling up. And we can tell which
section is on the page because of this counter, it's zero indexed in
this case for a specific reason that we'll get to in just a minute. It
doesn't have to be you can set it set the first section two and one in
the second, section two, but we're going to use the zero indexing for a
reason.</p>
I have the first section is zero, second section is one and so on. And
you can see that the script is working. And this is a big deal because
now we have a script where we can keep track of not only when we're
scrolling, but when certain sections are on the page, based on the
height of that section, that we're calculating when the page loads,
including all the images, because they have an effect on the height of
these elements.

</p>
<p>If this seems a bit cumbersome and confusing, that's okay, that's
natural. It's not easy to wrap your head around. However, the hard part
of the script is over. The rest is fairly easy to do, but the hard part

</p>
<p>This is where the magic happens, is in the 'if ' and in the 'elseif'

where we are in the page in relation to our various sections of the
page.</p>

</p>
<p>The next thing we need to do is to take advantage of the script to
change the highlighting of these actual pieces based on which section
we&amp;apost;re at. That's the last part of the script that we need to
do, and that part is not very difficult at this point. What I'm going to
do up here at the top is I'm just going to make another variable <b>‘var
allLinks’</b> and that can hold dollar sign, parenthesis, and then what
is it over here, I've got a navigation appears just now, <b>'nav ul li
a'</b>. I just want to put those anchor tags: <b>'nav ul li a'</b>, into
a variable called <b>‘allLinks’</b> because I'm going to use that to
affect this.</p>
<p>Then down here I'm going to make another variable called '<b>var</b>
<b>prevCounter</b>', and set that to zero. You'll see why in a minute
for the previous counter, you'll see why we need that as we go forward
here. Add these two variables, one that's just going to gather all the
links just for a short cut, we don't have to take this out every time,
and then one for previous counter that set to zero.</p>

</p>
<p>Now to make use of that I'm going to come down here, I'm going to add
an an extra if statement and I'm going to paste it in here to see that
you have to watch me type it. I'm going to add another if statement, and
you're going to have to type this in. If counter is not the same as
exclamation point, equals not the same as previous counter, then we want
to take all links, and remove the class attribute so that I'll remove
selected from all of those anchor tags up there. Then we want to take
the link with <b>eq</b>. <b>eq</b> is a function in jQuery that's like
equals.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 212. update class attribute of section (111) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image212.webp"
  alt="Update class attribute of section."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>I'm going to get the a tag that equals counter. For the first section
counter would be zero, for the second one or for the first anchor tag,
if we're in the first section, the first link that goes with that anchor
tag is number zero, and the second one is one, and the third one is two,
and the fourth one is three, and the fifth one is four like that. This
is why I'm using the zero indexed thing for counters here, is because
the eq function here in jQuery is a zero indexed function. So eq zero
will get the first one, you now add the class selected to fill them up
at the top of the page. Then the first link gets the class selected, and
then if I'm on the second one, so on and so forth, so that the correct
one gets to the correct class selected. Then I set previous counter to
be the same as counter, so now it's the same. This if statement will
fire every single time, you scroll just a tiny little bit, but it will
only do something when you've scrolled into a new section, either by
scrolling up or by scrolling down.</p>
<p>When you scroll down into a new section, the counter gets
incremented, and then this becomes a true statement so that it does
this. But it will only do this stuff in here when the counter actually
changes. Then once it's changed, these two things are set to be equal,
and it won't fire again until you go into another section. That should
actually work. Let's see if that works.</p>

</p>
<p>Come over here, I'm going to just scroll up to the top here, refresh
the page, and then now as I scroll down into my second section, you can
see that the class was removed from all of these links and added to that
one. As we go down into the third section, it now highlights that link
(3<sup>rd</sup> section). As they go into the fourth section it
highlights that link, and then going up that will do the correct thing
going up as well. This isn't very exciting to see these changing here.
Certainly not super exciting, but think about everything else that we
could do on the page. You could add a class to these elements that make
the move when they come onto the screen or something like that. You
could do really anything based on whether when you're scrolling or where
your scrolling to. This script gives you a lot of power over that thing,
and that's really cool.</p>

<p>What I'm going to do here, is I'm going to click this button here,
which toggles the device toolbar thing here. What I want to point out is
that the script is responsive, ready in the sense that if I go up to the
top of my page here and refresh, when the page loads, no matter how wide
my browser window is, it's going to calculate how tall each of these
sections are and it'll be fine.</p>

<p>If I've got a narrow browser on a phone or a small tablet or
something like that, or a wide browser and a screen with a big window,
big screen on a computer or something like that, then it'll adjust
itself accordingly and that's fine. However, what it won't do is handles
the situation well, where somebody resizes their browser window while
they're actually looking at the page, because when you resize the
browser window, the amount of space that these sections will take up
could potentially change Section 5, your goods from being, short to
tall. The length of that changes and we need to recalculate the height
of each section if somebody resizes their browser screen.</p>
<p>The other thing that's a problem is if somebody refreshes the page
while they're scrolled down the page, the page will load, but it will
load scroll down, but the counter gets at zero, which means the first
section gets highlighted. Let's take a look at that real quick.</p>
<p>Now I'm looking at Section 5, but the first section is highlighted,
and that's no good. That's not really great. Now, how often does this
happen? Probably not terribly often, but even still, it's the little
glitchy thing that we could just clean up and make a little bit better.
That's what we're going to do in the last part of the script is to
handle these two situations for this and while we're at it, we're going
to find a trick that's actually going to be really useful for other
scripts, for handling the same things that could happen.</p>

sign <b>window.on</b>, we're going to use the on method again, but
instead of looking for load we're going to look for resize. Then we're

<p>I'm just going to set out a variable and it's going to be undefined at the moment, but 
down here, I'm going to insert my resize function here. I can get rid of this console log. 
I don't need that one. Actually, I'm just going to leave it there for a moment because we're
going to use the console log anyway.</p>

<p>But in here, I'm going to do a set time out in here for this. I'm going to a set time and 
it's <b>doneResizing</b> and assign it the <b>setTimeout</b> function. SetTimeout method here, 
and remember, setTimeout takes a function, like that, and then a comma and then an amount of 
time. Then I said it's a really short amount of time, like half a second, 500 that's fine. We 
move that down there and then up here, I'm going to do clearTimeout, doneResizing, and then 
I'm going to just move this console log so that it's in here, just so we can see what the 
heck is going on, console log doneResizing. What's happening here is, remember clearTimeout 
stops the Timeout from happening.</p>

<p>While I'm resizing my window, clearTimeout, going to fire, and setTimeout is going to 
stop. As soon as I'm done actually resizing my window, then this will stop running, 
doneResizing will give me 500 milliseconds, and then it'll cancel. I got okay, I'm done 
resizing and that's a nice cheater's way of knowing when I finished resizing the window 
because this is going to keep this thing from actually happening until I stop resizing the
window. Until this method stops happening, which is happening while this event is going to 
be happening while I'm resizing the window. But as soon as I'm done, then the set time me 
out will run in a week, 500 milliseconds console log after it's done resizing, I hope.

what setting my postTops. When I get these two things, I'm just going to
copy them from there and paste them in here.</p>

<p>After I'm doneResizing, I'm going to reset this variable post tops
and I'm going to put each of the posts in here and down here, let's
actually console log out, postTops here. Then also up at the top of the
page where I have postTops console log out here, I'm going to uncomment
that out and save that, and now we should be able to test this and see
if it's working.</p>

<p>Over here, when I refresh the page, it should tell me where it thinks
the postTops are based on the height of those elements. When I'm done
resizing, I get new postTops. The first one still at 200, that's fine.
That makes sense, but the next one is a much higher number, and so on
and so forth.</p>

</p>
<p>We've solved the first part of our problem with what happens if
somebody resizes the window. But we haven't solved the second part of
what happens if somebody refreshes the page while they're further down
the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 236/237. what happens when you refresh while scrolling? (123) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="What happens when you refresh while scrolling?" />
<img src="./images/webp/image237.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="What happens when you refresh while scrolling?" />
</p>
<p>What I want to do for this is I'm going to come down here into my
script down here. I'm going to piece something in. You're going to have
to type it. It's a little bit long, but you can put it together pretty
quickly, I think. But rather than watching me type it all that, I'm
going to put it in first I'm going to get rid of this console log here.
I don't really need that to get rid of that. I'm going to move this down
here. I'm going to piece in this piece of code here.</p>
<p>Let's take it line by line, so this is going to handle what happens
if somebody refreshes the page while they're scrolled further down the
page, I'm going to make a variable (counter). I'm going to take my
variable pagePosition. Let me make a variable pagePosition, and make it
equal to window scrollTop plus 210, so we know that that's going to be
assigned how far down the screen scrolled plus 210 pixels. I'm going to
set my counter to zero and then I'm going to use a loop and then I loop
through my postTops these postTops here that I set that tell me where my
tops of my pages are the tops of my sections.</p>
<p>I'm going to loop through those and I'm going to check to see if this
page position is greater than each element in postTops, and if it is,
I'm going to increment the counter so the counter starts at zero. If I'm
scrolled at the very top of the page, then page position would be zero
plus two hundred and ten pixels. I know my first postTop is two hundred
pixels down, so counter's going to get incremented from zero to one. If
I'm in the second one, it'll get incremented from one to two, if I
scroll down into the third post, it's going to get incremented from two
to three. All and so on and so forth, so I'm checking each one of these
section tops up here, postTops against how far down I am on the page,
and the camera will get incremented if the pages scroll down that
far.</p>
<p>Now, remember, I want the counter to be zero indexed. If I'm scrolled
up at the very top of the page, I don't want the counter to be one. I
want it to be zero. If I'm on the second one, I don't want it to be two,
I want it to be one. If I'm on the third section, I don't want it to be
three. I want it to be two. Then I decrement the counter. Finally, all I
need to do is remove the class from all links and then put the
appropriate class in the appropriate link. That's really cool and that
should work.</p>

</p>
<p>Now, if I see this and notice, I do have this inside the resize
function, which is not great, and we'll fix that in a minute. But we'll
take care of that in a minute. But really, for right now, it's fine if I
come over here and refresh the page. You'll notice he didn't pick the
right thing, but if I resize the page. Notice that when I was done, it
actually picked the correct section that I was on. If I come up here and
resize the page. Notice it switched this to the correct section. Section
two I mean. If I resize the page again. I'm still in the second section.
But you get the idea it is actually working and doing the right thing. I
know I went through it quickly, but make sure you get all of this in
here, the script here, and then this piece is just to copy and paste of
this piece. A lot of it you can actually copy and paste. You have to
write the for loop for the first time. But other than that, the rest of
it is copy and paste. Now, we're doing a lot of this stuff twice, so
we're going to actually take some of this stuff out of here and put it
into its own function. We'll do that in the next lesson.</p>

We look up of this one here, window load function, which closes way down
here. But I'm going to put it after the window resize on resize
function, so I'm going to put it after here, in fact, I'm going to get
rid of a little bit of space there, and there we go. I'm going to add in
here a function resetPagePosition.</p>

I'm going to put all of this stuff that comes inside this set time out
here. The post tops, we've done resizing and this function here, but
post tops all the way down to this and selected thing here. The set time
out function is going to end here, but all of the guts inside of there
with post tops and everything, all of that, I'm just going to cut and
stick it inside this function instead. You might have to select it and

<p>But I'm also going to run it up at the top of the page here,

comment this out, <b>console.log</b>, <b>postTops</b>. I'm going to
create my variable <b>postTops</b>, but then inside here I'm going to
adjust my <b>postTops</b> based on when the page loads. This function is
going to run twice. It's going to run when the page loads and it's going
to run any time you resize the screen.</p>

  alt="Reset array postTops."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"

</p>
<p>When the page loads we want to do all of these things. We want to get
it. We want to make sure postTops is emptied out, put the tops of all of
our posts in there, and again, we're setting this again here to an empty
array because we want to make sure it gets zeroed out right away.</p>
<p>Then I want to put all of these things in here and then I want to set
my page position to wherever I am on the page, set my calendar year, and
figure out where I am on the page and the color that links the correct
thing. That should all work. Now, if I go over here and test this after
saving that. Hopefully, I did it right. "Refresh. " Notice second
section, it should have maybe first section, second section, third
section. We're searching. Now, if I refresh the page while I'm down the
page, No, it didn't work right there. Third section, second section,
seems to be a little bit off. I don't know. Yeah, it seems to be
working. I'm up here at the top of the page if I click "Refresh." I'm at
the top of the page. If I go down to the second option and click
"Refresh," the second section becomes highlighted. We go down to the
third section and click "Refresh."</p>
<p>Now into the second section. It's on the cusp there, maybe that's
why. Now, I'm not sure why it's a little bit off. But it's pretty close.
Again, this is an edge-case scenario, but it'd be nice if it worked
exactly right. If I resize my screen, it should, when I'm done resizing,
choose the correct section. Separate sections on the screen. It does
seem to be mostly working. Section, refresh the page, that section got
highlighted, so that's correct.</p>

</p>
<p>The last thing we could do here is on our Index page. Since it's
being added programmatically, we don't need class selected here at all
because that should get added automatically when the page loads. If I go
back up here to the top and click "Refresh," it's automatically adding
that.</p>
<p>My other script should work to where if I click on the next section
that you go down to the correct section. You can see that it's slightly
refreshing that, and the reason I think it's doing that is that it could
be in some cases, actually reloading the page.</p>

</p>
<p>One way to keep that from happening is in our script up here at the
top. The script here. I mean down here at the end, return false, and
I'll make it so that it clicking these links. It'll perform the same
thing as event prevent default, return false, or keep the registration
of the click of these links and keep those hashtags from showing up in
the address bar. If I do that and then come back here, if I remove this
hash second, scroll up to the top of the page, click "Enter," and then
now if I click these, it should go to the correct thing. We're not
getting the house up there. If I scroll down manually, it's highlighting
the correct section. That's really great.</p>
<p>This is a really good script that you could use for all kinds of
things, and it might need a little bit of refining on that last bit that
I showed you. But it's really pretty exciting. We're going to do one
last lesson on this where we just look at the different pieces and
review what we've done.</p>

</p>
<p>This is quite an extensive script. We've done a lot here. I just want
to go through it once quickly, to review what we've done.</p>

  alt="."

</p>
<p>We started with the smooth scroll script, which handles what happens
when you click on one of the section tabs, and it gets the ‘href’ of
that section, and then animates to that section on the page minus 200
pixels, because we're starting on page 200 pixels from the top of the
window. We're doing that using the ease in plug in, and then when we're
done doing that, we want to remove all of the classes from all the
anchor tags, and then put the correct one on the correct tag.</p>
<p>Maybe we should actually even remove this part of the script, I think
possibly because now we have the other part that's handling this. That's
something to consider. But that's what that first part of that script
does.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 253.  (131) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image253.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>The second part of the script, is handling when the page loads in all
the images and everything loads. We're creating some variables, getting
our sections, setting a counter, in a previous counter and that's
doneResizing variable here as well as the postTops.</p>
<p>Then we run resetPagePosition, and reset page position is looking at
how far down the page each element is, that we're tracking and puts that
into an array and then figures out how far down the page we're actually
scrolled, and so on and so forth. Also, it will handle the situation for
when it'll recalculate those things when we resize the screen but that
happens later, so we set all that page position stuff.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 254.  (132) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image254.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>The magic of the script is actually happening here. When you scroll
the page we're capturing that scroll event, and as we scroll the page,
we're checking to see if we go into each section. When we do we
increment the counter. That counter only gets incremented when we go
into the section, and we're watching for the change in that counter,
because when that counter changes, when it's different from previous
counter, then we can do something on the page, and that's pretty
cool.</p>
<p>Then we set previews counter to counter, and we're ready for the next
change. This script is the heart of the whole thing in terms of figuring
out everything that should happen there on the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 255.  (133) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image255.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>Then finally, we have the ‘window on resize’, and we're using
clearTimeout to keep the setTime out from happening until we're actually
done resizing.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 256.  (133) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image256.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>It's clearing done resizing while we're resizing, and then as soon as
we're done, it waits half a second, and runs this reset page position
again, which we already talked about, which sets the tops of all of our
pages, of all of our sections and figures out how far down the page we
are and sets the styling for the links appropriately.</p>

<img src="./images/webp/image258.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>The only thing I can think to do is maybe to remove these two pieces
here. I'm going to take those out just for a minute to see, if that
makes our script function just slightly better. Now when we get to this
function, then we could get rid of this callback function entirely if
this works.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 259/260.  (134) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image260.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>But let's see if this does what we wanted to do here, and then come
back here to the top of the page, refresh the page, and now when I click
second section, because the second section and because the other script
is controlling. I'm this far down the page, I have to highlight the
correct script. The other script is actually handling the changing of
the highlighting here, and I actually don't need that in the other
script. I think the two are affecting each other a little bit, so now
both scripts are working.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 261/262.  (135) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  alt="." />
<img src="./images/webp/image262.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>You could come back here, and take out this callback function
entirely all the way down to there, and have a slightly shorter script,
assuming it didn't screw something up there. I think I did the right
thing out of there. Let's just check. You can go to the third section, I
can go to the site for a section, I can go through a section, and then I
can also do it manually. It should work where if you refresh the page,
it should highlight the correct section, although it seems that might
need a little bit of work in some cases. Section 3, refresh. In Section
4, refresh. That seems to be working now. Section 5, refresh. Seems to
be working. Great, so everything's working the way it's supposed to, and
you have a script that you could use to create all interesting
interactions as you scroll down the page, all done in JQuery. We'll do
the same script, and play JavaScript.</p>

</p>
Only this one, we are going to use plain JavaScript instead. And that
will allow you to compare the syntax between jQuery and JavaScript and
improve your JavaScript script skills. Also, this is a fairly
complicated script. It is a little hard to wrap your head around. So,
doing it twice will actually help you, and I think you will see that
there's a lot of similarities between the JavaScript version, and the
jQuery version.

</p>
<p>The second thing I want you to notice is that, or to remember is that
this header is fixed at the top of the page and the CSS. So, the content
slides beneath it, and we have got some padding on the body here to push
the content of the page down, and we can see that in the html over here
in the CSS where the body has some padding on the top of 200 pixels, and
the header is set to position fixed. Top zero with 100%. And, these
things will make make it, so, that the header stays fixed up at the top
of the page. But, the contents of the page is starting 200 pixels down
here for the far Section one. So, that is important to remember. Okay,
great, so with those basic pieces in mind we are ready to get started
with our JavaScript, and the first thing we want to do is gather all of
these links in our navigation.</p>

</p>
<p>Come over to our script.js file, ignore this smooth scroll function
for a moment. We will get to that in a while but come on over here, and
then, we just need a variable constant. Now, navLinks is assigned
documents, query selector all, and what do I want to get? I am going to
get these links over here, nav ul l I a I want to get all of those
anchor tags that are in there in the un ordered list, and side list
items there. So, nab U L L I A. If you had other links on the page,
inside of a navigation like this, you would have to give this knave an
ID. And then, call it by D to make sure you are getting just these here.
But that will get those and then we want to loop through them, and put a
click handler on each one.</p>
<p>And we could use a traditional for loop. We could do that, that would
be fine, we could do that, I kind of like that for each method in
JavaScript that we can use with arrays because nah Vilnyx is now an
array of elements in array of anchor tags, so, I kind of like that
better. So, I am going to just do knave links, .forEach like so, and, as
always we want to type from the inside out, and so, that we understand
exactly what we are doing here for each takes a function that is going
to run each time that we for each one of these links. So, up here inside
here, you need to pass in a variable, whoops, no quotes because it is a
variable each like each think, and so as for each runs, its going to
pass each one of these anchor tags into each link here, and I can just
simply do each link, add event, listener, I am going to listen for a
click, and then I am going to run a function think. So now, I could go
ahead, and put my code right inside these curly braces here and run
forward with that. But instead, what I want to do instead is I want to
make a separate function function, smooth scroll, do, smooth scrolling,
and the year I am going to pass in the event object and you event not
prevent default, so you do not register the clicks on the links and this
could be the word of and, or it could just be E or E V T a lot of times
people will do that, E V T.</p>
<p>Thank you, so I am going to leave an event just because I think it is
helpful, and that is a little bit more letters but it is just a
variable. And then, up here instead of running this function, I am going
to run smooth scroll here as a named function, and notice it does not
get the parentheses up here. The parentheses do not go here because,
this is just a pointer to this function down here. We do not want to
actually run the function here. We want to put a pointer to this
function here, and when you click it, if we put the parentheses there,
then it will run right away, and not even wait for the click. So, we
want to just put the pointer debt to this function down here, and let it
run that way.</p>

</p>
Next, we want to get the href of the link that we clicked, the one that
we clicked on, and we could use the this keyword, but in some cases,
event.target is a little bit more direct and explicit.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 270. getting the target smoothscroll (139) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image270.webp"

  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"

</p>
So event.target get attribute href, we'll find out which link we
clicked. And if we go back to our code over here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 271. match link with href # link (140) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  alt="Match link with href pound link (#first - #fifth)."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
When you click on one of these links, first, second, third or fourth,
you're getting this href pound first or pound second or pound third,
pound forth and fifth. Which again match the IDs down here (bottom of
code above) for our sections. So the idea is that if we can get this,
then we can find out, okay, which section
document.querySelector(targetID). So this is going to hold either pound
first, pound, second, pound third, pound fourth or pound fifth. So in
targetAnchor, I'm going to get my targetID. Here I call the variable
targetSection.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image273.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Example scroll effects with javascript." />
</p>
TargetSection and it's going to go get that targetID. When you click on
one of those, the event.target can only click on one link at a time,
even though we put the event listener in all of them, you can only click
one link at a time. Which one did you click get the href that goes with
that one, put it in targetID and then we can go get that section and
that's our targetSection there.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>To test this out let's run a console log here, console.log and pass
into the console log as a statement that looks like this. So we're going
to say targetSection.getBoundingClientRect().top. This method,
getBoundingClientRect, we'll get me the shape of that box that section
is in and .top will tell me what the top edges, .bottom would give me
the bottom edge. We can get the left and we can get the right, but that
will get me that kind of thing.</p>

</p>
<p>Let's actually save this and see if I'm doing my job well over here
by coming over here and inspect this. And when I click one of these
sections, I should get in the console here, miss my console. There we
go. When I click on one of these. Refreshments page, click on one of
these, I'm getting a number of pixels from the top of the screen that
that item is, with all its decimal points. 200, getting these different
positions here. And notice it's not going to that point on the page and
that's because we have the event to prevent default in there.</p>
So now it's no longer going down to those sections, it's just
registering out, how many pixels down the page those items are. So we
have some links working where we can click on them and find out, how far
down the page each of those sections are. We don't really need all the
decimal points. All these places be on the decimal point, we can just
round this down. So we'll do that in the next lesson and assign this
value to a variable that we can actually use rather than just have it
spit out in the console. Well, we'll do that in the next lesson.

</p>
So instead of console.log here, I'm going to take that out, check out
the path to see at the end and instead I'm going to create a variable
here, 'const original', you know, 'Top' and assign it, 'target.Section',
Bounding.Rect Top'. Now, I really don't need it to have all of the
decimal points that we're showing up on the page, so I can round that
down here. I can put, <b>Math.floor</b>, parentheses and put the other
parentheses over here and then really what I want is 200 pixels down the
page, so I'm going to subtract 200 'minus 200', just remember, that's my
First Section, starts with 200 pixels down the page, so we really want
our, when we see scroll, we want it to smooth scroll to this position,
200 pixels down, not all the way up at the top of the window, because
that wouldn't really help us.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 279.  (144) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image279.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>Now, that we have this variable value in this variable here, we can
use it using the window 'Scroll by' method. This is the method that's
going to provide the smooth scrolling magic, and it takes as an argument
an object, and again, we haven't really talked in depth about objects
yet. You've seen them a few times in the lesson where we talk about them
in depth is coming up soon and probably ready for it now that you've
seen them a few times. But this object is going to take three
parameters. It's going to take the top parameter, which is going to be
our variable here, 'originalTop'. That's to copy and paste, you don't
spell it. That's one. It's going to take the 'left' variable, the 'left'
property, which is just zero. We're not doing anything special with
that, and then we have a 'behavior' property, which is going to be set
to 'smooth'.</p>
If I see that and test it, I believe it will work before I try it, I'm
just going to 'console.log', 'originalTop', just so you can see what's
in that variable, each time we click, one of these links should be what
we saw before.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image281.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and test this. If I refresh my page, starting up
stride up here at the top of the page, 'refresh' and I click 'Second
Section', you can see it does a smooth scroll down there and I'm getting
the number of pixels there. The First Section is working, too, so they
can go to whichever section, and you can tell when I'm going up the
page, notice it's got a negative number. For how many pixels it's moved
up for that 'four original top there'. That's working great.</p>
You will notice a few things about the script, though. One is that we're
not setting the amount of time like we could do with the jquery version,
nor do we have an opportunity to set the easing. We could probably with
a bit more work, we could make use of that. We could do that by using
some [inaudible] animations to do this, instead of this method here with
the scroll, the 'scrollBy' method, we could probably do this in a
different way. The other thing that's important to note is that not all
browsers support this behavior 'smooth'. Safari does not yet, so if I
test this in Safari, here I am on the same page in Safari and I click on
'Third Section', it just pops to the 3rd Section, it's going to the
right location. It's not going all the way up to the top of the window,
but the behavior 'smooth' is not working. That's a bit of a problem, and
we'll talk about it more in the next lesson.

<h2 name="ch2-21">2.21 Smooth Scroll Polyfill (4:45)</h2>

  alt="2.21. Smooth Scroll Polyfill."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="40%;" />
</p>
<p>In the last lesson (2.20), we noticed that the Smooth Scroll was
working fine here in Chrome, but it's not working properly in Safari.
What can we do about that? What we can do is we can use what's called a
<b>Polyfill</b>. A <b>polyfill</b> is a term that was created by a
developer named Remy Sharp.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 283/284.  (146) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image283.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
<img src="./images/webp/image281.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
If you go just google 'who invented <b>polyfill</b>?' or 'where did the
Polyfill name come from?', Remy Sharp has written on his blog, in 2010,
an article about how he came up with the name <b>polyfill</b>. That's
where it came from. But really, what a <b>polyfill</b> is, it's a shim
or some piece of script that's made to help browsers that are not
compliant yet with standards work and those browsers will use that extra
script to make it work. These days, most of the browsers are pretty up
to date in standards and there's very little need for <b>polyfills</b>,
but it's a worthwhile concept to know about and it's worth figuring out
how to use them.

<img src="./images/webp/image286.webp"

  alt="." />
</p>
As it turns out, somebody wrote a <b>polyfill</b> for this particular
thing, and it's over here on GitHub. It's this 'iamdustan' character,
and GitHub wrote this smooth scroll polyfill. You could download this
file here by clicking the download zip, here. I also have the same file
already in the folder over here, so if you were to download that, it
would be here. It's the same file here. I have this file in my folder,
here. All we need to do is link to it. Here, on the page, at the bottom
of the page, here, I want to link to that file, script
src="smoothscroll.js" that one there.

  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>There we go. I want to put it before my script, so it loads first.
Just by plugging that in, it'll now work in Safari. If I go back and
test Safari again, refresh this page, refresh button's over here in
Safari, scroll to the top of the page, second section, now it's actually
working in Safari, the same as it worked in Chrome. That's pretty cool.
Understanding, sometimes, developers create these additional scripts
that you can use and just get access to is really helpful. We've now
finished the smooth scroll part of the script, and it's working great,
as you can see.</p>
The one thing we haven't done is made it so that the different links
highlight as you click on the different sections. But that's going to
get fixed when we do the next script and we make them highlight based on
where down the page we are. We don't need to make them highlight when
we're actually clicking on them because it'll do it automatically with
the second part of the script.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 288.  (148) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image288.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
This is a really great little script. You can see that it's fairly
short. It doesn't have all the features that the other one had and that
we aren't setting [inaudible] and we aren't setting the amount of time
for the actual animation, but you could do that if you wanted to work on
it further. You could add some CSS animations and instead of using the
scroll button method, you could actually hook in and apply those CSS
properties as we go to those points in the page. You can do that on your
own. For now, we're going to go forward and do the second part of this
script, which is the part where when we scroll down the page manually,
it changes the highlighting in the navigations. We'll again be working
with scrolling and capturing the scrolling.

</p>
We have the script that does the smooth scroll, and now we're going to
do the second part of the script, which again is going to take place
inside of an event and it's going to make sure that all of the images
and everything have loaded onto the page. The reason for that is we need
to calculate the height of each section and the height of each section
is going to depend on the images in that section. So if the images
haven't loaded then the height will be different. We want to make sure
everything's loaded before we actually start calculating things like the
height of each section.

  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>This is exactly the same as what we did in the jQuery version, except
the syntax just a little bit different. Because instead of using the
jQuery object, we're going to put an event listener on the window at
event listener and we're going to say," load." You're going to run a
function like so. It doesn't look that different from jQuery at this
point. It's fairly similar. Remember, in jQuery we would use the jQuery
object to get the window and we'd use the on method and we would check
for load and then run function. A little bit shorter, a little bit more
compact, but not really all that different. We're going to use this one
down here with clean JavaScript window out of industry. Look. What are
we going to put in there?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 291.  (150) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image291.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>We're going to put some variables. First, I'm just going to paste
these in, you're going to have to type up. I have a variable called post
that goes into my document query selectAll and gets all the sections,
because that's what I'm going to be scrolling to, is the different
sections of the page. I'm going to put that into posts and then I've got
my arrayed four post tops and you already know what that's going to be.
That's going to be used to hold the number of pixels down from the top
of the page. Each section is page top, which is going to change as we
scroll down the page. It's going to have a number that represents how
far above the top of the viewport the pages. Then we've got the counter
in the previous counter and we'll use done resizing later for our script
that deals with what happens if people are resizing their window. So
we'll do that again as well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 292.  (151) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image292.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>Now, one thing you might notice here, is that the counter is being
set to one, and the previous count is being set to one instead of zero.
That's because on this script, we're going to have our sections indexed
at one instead of indexed at zero. In the jQuery version, we use zero
indexing because we use the E Q method, which uses zero indexing to
change the properties on each of the navigation items. But here we're
going to use a different method, so we don't need the zero indexing, we
can index it once. The counter starts at one and the previous counter
starts at one, and each section will be, the first section will be one
and the second section will be two, third section three, fourth section
four and fifth section 5. In some ways, that's actually a little bit
easier. You don't have to deal with the zero indexing and the cognitive
work that provides. But we've got this here and we're ready to go
forward with the next part.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image294.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Now, we use this method in the previous script, getBoundingClientRect
at top. We use that to find the top of the particular element in the
previous script and we're going to use that again. But let's cancel log
it out, so when you cancel that log and surround that with parentheses.
Really what I want to do, is I want to get posts. I want to get the
first posts, so I'm going to do posts square brackets, zero.get pounding
Plan Recto. Let's come to log that out.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 295.  (152) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image295.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>If I go over here to my page and I turn on my inspector, you're going
to switch it over and looking at my cancel, make sure you scroll up here
at the top and then refresh the page. It's telling me minus 508 pixels,
I think because it should be a 200. Cancel log posts zero. John and Joe
cut out that last bit of going to the page and having it not work and
pick it up from here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 296/297.  (153) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image297.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
When I go back to the Web page and refresh, you'll notice that I get a
200 here, because I know that this first post starts 200 pixels down the
page, so that's working. But notice if I scroll down the page a little
bit and refresh, you get a minus 71 or minus 397. It's telling me where
on the page that element is, but really what I want to know, I want to
know exactly what the number is. I want that 200 to stay constant for
that, because I want to know when the page loads how far down is the top
of each of these sections. I don't want it to change. I'm going to need
to do something to adjust that number and fix that, and we'll take care
of that in the next lesson.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch2-23">2.23 Top Posts (5:35)</h2>

</p>
In the last lesson, we saw that we could use the
<b>getBoundingClientRect().top</b> to get the top of any particular
element on the page. In this case, the first element, the first section,
we're getting here posts, zero.

</p>
But we don't want where it is anywhere on the page. We want to get the
distance. It is from the top of the window, from when the page loads and
have that be consistent. We can do that by adding to it
<b>window.pageYOffset</b>. That's the amount of pixels the window has
scrolled past the viewport, and by adding that back on there, we will
always get 200 pixels. Let's go ahead and give that a try.

</p>
At the end here, we need to add plus window.pageYOffset. This one, not X
but Y. It should be a plus window <b>pageYOffset</b>. Now, let's save
that and then come over here. I'm going to make sure I'm scrolled up to
the top of the window. Click, "Refresh" and you can see I get 200 there.
If I scroll the page down and refresh again, you can see that I get 200
there. I always get 200 for that first post.

<p>Great. Now, that we've got that, the next thing we need to do is
round it down using our <b>Math.floor</b>, because some of these will
generate a whole bunch of partial points past decimal point that we
don't need. We can just round it down to the nearest pixel, and then put
all of those into an array, just like we did in the previous script. We
already have our <b>postTops</b> array created here. It's empty. But we
can push into it our posts, and we can do that with the <b>forEach</b>
method. Again, we can do <b>posts.forEach</b>. I really like this method
because it's nice and clean and simple to read. It's a little bit
shorter. You could use a for-loop, certainly. That would be fine to use
a standard for-loop. But I like this method, so I'm going to use it. I'm
going to pass in a function.</p>
<p>Then remember, this function is going to pass in a variable post.
Because this is a variable, you can call it whatever you want. I think
post makes sense. Then in here, I'm going to say, I'm going to push
<b>postTops.push</b>. What am I going to push here? I'm going to push
this whole thing, so I can copy and paste that in here. But not post
zero. I just want my variable post, this variable here. Because it's
going to go through each of these posts, and do each post. It's going to
push the first post in, the second post in and so on. I've made a little
extra room here because I also need to put in here, <b>Math.floor()</b>,
and the second parentheses will close here like so. <b>Math.floor</b>
will take this, round it down and then it gets pushed into postTops.</p>

</p>
<p>Then, of course, we want to cancel log out postTops just to see what
the heck is going on. We don't need this one anymore. In fact, I'm just
going to cut that from there. Stick it down here and change this to
postTops. Now, we should be able to see when we go back to our page over
here.</p>

If I refresh, I'm getting the same numbers that I got before in the
jQuery version. This is the exact same thing I'm getting of the top of
my posts. Hopefully, this is starting to feel a little bit familiar. It
really helps with the script, because it's confusing. Capturing and the
scroll of it is confusing. It helps to do it a couple of times. Here
we're doing it with plain JavaScript instead. But really, all the steps
are the same, and it's the same process. It's just the syntax, that's a
little bit different.

</p>
In the last module, we put all the tops of our posts or our sections
really into post tops, and we can alert our council logged that out so
we know where they all are.

</p>
Again, we're putting all of this inside the window load event because we
want to make sure that the page loads so that we get the correct numbers
for those tops of those posts, because if we don't get the correct
numbers then, nothing's going to line up properly, it won't work. We
want to make sure that all the images load because that's going to
affect how tall each section is and where the top of the next section
starts. That's why we're putting everything inside of the window
function.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 307.  (158) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image307.webp"

  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Now we're at the point where we're ready to start working with our
scroll event. We need to add an event listener for capturing scroll
effects. I'm just going to comment that out for now. But we can add that
list of recapturing scroll of effects. Again, I'm going to attach it to
the window, <b>window.addEventListener</b>, and we're listening for
scroll event, then we're going to run a function, and all of our stuff
will go inside of here. Now, this looks very similar to the jQuery
version of the scroll event.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 308.  (159) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image308.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
In jQuery, we did it like this. We used the jQuery objects to grab our
window and then we use the on method to capture scroll, and then run a
function. Again, it looks very similar, but just slightly different, the
jQuery version is a few characters shorter, so that makes learning this
stuff a little bit easier, I think, in jQuery. But the plain JavaScript
syntax is not that much longer and you don't have to download the entire
jQuery library to use it, or force your users to download the entire
jQuery library to use it. That's nice.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 309.  (159) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image309.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Then we're going to put into this variable pagetop. Pagetop it's going
to equal this thing, <b>window.pageYOffset</b>. Again, what that does is
it, <b>window.pageYOffset</b> tracks how far off the top of the window
or page is scrolled.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 310.  (160) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image310.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
I can, <b>console.log</b>, put <b>pageTop</b> and we should be seeing
those pixels change as we scroll down the page. Let's test that and see.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 311/312.  (160) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image311.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
<img src="./images/webp/image312.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
I come back here and refresh my page. Now as I scroll down the page, you
can see those pixels are going up. Again as before, with the jQuery
version, we're capturing every little bit that scrolls, but we're not
necessarily capturing every single pixel. The slower we scroll, the more
pixels will capture. But the faster we scroll, the fewer pixels will
capture. But that event is firing every time we scroll a little bit. We
get up to the top of the page, we should be getting a zero. When we get
down to the bottom of the page, we should be getting a number that
represents the full height of the entire window.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 313.  (161) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image313.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>That's working great, and really what I want to do is I want to track
not the very top of the window, but the start of this first thing or
maybe a little bit down from it. I want to push down a little bit from
there. Really what I want to do is I want to come back and add 250 to
this. It had 210 in the other one, but I'm going to do 250 here. I think
it's a little bit better. I'm going to add 250 there.</p>
It's worth noting that the strategy for this script is exactly the same
as what we did for the jQuery script. When this number the
<b>pagetop</b> number, is greater than the number of the second section
for <b>postTops</b>, where that one starts, then we must be viewing that
second section on the screen, and if it's greater than the number for
the top of the third section, then we must be viewing that section on
the screen, and so on. That strategy is exactly the same.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 314.  (162) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

</p>
As before, you can either be scrolling down the page, starting at the
top, or going down. Or you could be somewhere in the middle of the page
and scrolling up. Those are really your only two options, because this
page doesn't scroll left and right. Those are the two conditions that we
need to watch out for, while we're handling our scroll effect.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch2-25">2.25 The Magic Conditionals (5:58)</h2>

<img src="./images/webp/image315.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="40%;" />
</p>
<p>To handle those two situations of scrolling up and scrolling down, I
need an if and an else if, just as I did in the jQuery version and I'm
going to piece this in here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 316.  (163) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image316.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>You're going to have to type it, but I'm going to paste it in here,
because it's actually exactly the same as what we had in the previous
script. In fact, I don't think it's different really, even at all. I'm
going to comment out this console log call there. We don't really need
that now. But here I'm seeing if pagetop is greater than the
<b>postTops</b> <b>counter</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>counter</b> starts at one, so if it's greater than the first
element inside <b>postTops</b>, the <b>counter</b> is going to get
incremented. If we're on the first section, we go into the second
section, this <b>counter</b> would be one, and so now we're in that
second section, then we should increment the counter and we must be
scrolling down. Then when we go into the third section, we'll increment
the <b>counter</b> again and so on and so forth as we get down to the
bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Then the else if, we're going to check to see if the <b>counter</b>
is greater than one, not greater than zero this time, but greater than
one, is a greater than one, because one is our first section, and if
<b>pagetop</b> is less than <b>postTops</b> counter minus one. If it's
less than that, then we must be scrolling up if both of these are true,
in which case will decrement the counter.</p>
Let's give this a try. This should be showing us in our console over
here. You come back. Let's go up to the top of the page, click "Refresh"
and then scroll down the page. When I get to that second section, and
that second section it's 250 pixels from the top of the screen. The down
says scrolling down too. It's into the 250 pixels that did it. Should be
doing it. There, I see what I did wrong.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 317.  (164) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image317.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Over here. I put the plus 250 in the wrong place. Should be here. Plus
250, there we go. Lets try that. Scroll to the top of the page, there we
go. Now when I get to section two, scrolling down too, when that is 250
pixels from the top of the page, it hits it and says okay.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 318/319.  (164) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image319.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
We must be looking in section two, and this will get to 250, we've got
three, four, five, and then when we go up, we get four, three, two, one.
That's working great, so I can tell this thing is firing, not I'm not
getting calls for every single little imaging that I scroll. I'm only
getting calls when that section comes into the page, and that's the
beauty of the script. I think it's really wonderful. I love it. That's
what we were able to do with the jQuery version as well, and that's what
makes the script very powerful, because only when those things happen,
we're going to make other things happen on the page. Not for every
single pixel that we scroll.

  width="50%;" />
</p>
Just as before, we want to see if the <b>counter</b> is not the same as
the previous <b>counter</b>. Because if it isn't, then we've moved into
a new section, and the first thing we want to do is remove all of the
classes from those links at the top of the page, which is that class
selected that should be on one of them. But we want to make sure it
isn't done any of them will remove that class attribute from everything,
just to be clear that everything has no class on it up there.

</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and add this if statement over here. Down here I'm
going to add an if. If <b>counter</b> is not the same as
<b>prevCounter</b>. If they're not the same. Then again, I'm going to
use my <b>forEach</b> and I already have up here at the top of the page,
I already have <b>navLinks</b> gathering all these, so we've already got
this variable so we can just use it again.</p>
Just like before, I'm going to just do now <b>navLinks</b> for each
function, curly braces, each links. It's going to go through each links
of <b>navLinks</b>, and what is it going to do here, we're going to say,
each link, <b>removeAttribute</b>, this one here, which attribute are
you removing class. That'll remove the class attribute from each of
those. Great. We'll stop this lesson here, but in the next one will put
the correct class on the correct link. We'll put the selected class on
the most correct so that it can get highlighted properly. Put a
semicolon there before we go.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch2-26">2.26 Changing the Next Link (5:56)</h2>

We took the class attribute off of all the links, now we need to add it
to the correct link.

  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
So I'm going to add a variable, <b>const thisLink</b>, I want to add it
to the link that I clicked on. I'm going to get the correct link here by
using a query selector, so I'm going to say
<b>document.querySelector</b>, QuerySelector. And, this is a little
tricky this querySelector, what we're going to use is <b>nav ul, li
a</b>.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 324.  (168) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image324.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>But we want <b>li:nth-child()</b> because over here, in our HTML
remember, we want to get, If we clicked on this one, we want to get the
first list item's anchor tag, or the second list item's anchor tag or
the third list item's anchor tag. Remember the list items are all
siblings, the anchor tags are cousins, because there's only one anchor
tag in each list item, but the list items are all sibling. So there's
this is the first one, second, one, third, fourth one, fifth one. So
over here I want to get <b>nav ul li nth-child</b>, and if I were to put
in a one that would get the first link, the two would get the second
link, the three would get the third link and so on. So this is why we're
using 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 four our counters instead of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, in
the script.</p>
And the jQuery script, we use the <b>EQ method</b> to find the the
first, second, third and fourth link but that's zero indexed. So the
first one and that one is 0, or is the first one and this one is 1, so
that's why our counter's a little bit different in the script. But, we
could have probably used the nth=child method in the jQuery version and
had to be the same now that I think about it. And that would be another
way because remember in jQuery there's about 100 ways of getting to each
element on the page, so we could have done it this way as well there.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 325.  (169) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image325.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
But what I want to do is I want to change this so I'm using not my up
and down quotes, oops. Yeah yeah I know it's a problem. I want to use my
tick marks, so that in here I can pass in <b>${counter}</b>, and that
will get me the correct link there.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 326.  (169) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image326.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
From there it's simple, now I can use <b>thisLink.className =
'selected'</b>, which is if I've selected right. And then of course we
want to say <b>prevCounter</b>, is now assigned the same value as
counter, because now we're ready to go into the next section.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 327/328.  (170) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image328.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>So if I save that and test it, assuming I did it all right, it should
work let's see. Refresh the page, start up here at the top, now look at
that it's already working second, third, fourth, the fifth sections so
that's working perfectly fine. It's nice and smooth, because the
animation is happening within the CSS, and the JavaScript is super
efficient, because it's only calling these, as you move into these
sections. And not only that, but when you click on these, it'll actually
highlight their correct section, as you're going to and even sort of
highlight in between, it's that fast. So that's working really great,
I'm really pleased with the way that works.</p>
Over here in my console log, I can see where I'm scrolling up and
scrolling down and these numbers must be coming in, when I'm clicking on
one of these links, I must have left a console log open in that script
as well.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

</p>
<p>We could go over and clear out these console logs, we don't really
need them all. They're handy to have while we're making the script but,
we don't really need this one or this one, or up here and I must have
one up here somewhere as well here it is original top. So I don't need
those or you could just to keep them all together and that's great, and
the script is working.</p>
The last thing that we need to do is take care of the situation, there's
edge cases of what happens if somebody is resizing the window, or if
they refresh the page while you're scrolled down the page. And so we'll
take care of that in the next lesson, and then we're done with this
script and you'll have two versions of it, one that works with jQuery,
and one that works with plain Vanilla JavaScript.

</p>
Just as we did before, I want to add an event listener that captures
when I'm resizing my Window. So over here I'm going to get rid of a
little bit of spacing in here just because, I want to be able to see
everything here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 331.  (172) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>All right, so I want to add this event listener after the event
listener for my scroll function here, so I want to add it after that,
but before my event listener for when the Window loads. So when I added
in here, make sure you're putting it in the right place because that's
really important.</p>
And here I'm just a Window.outevent listener and I'm going to look for a
resize event. Eminent type functioning, that's going to run when the
Window resize is semi code and we will put stuff in here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 332.  (173) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image332.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
Now remember when we were doing JQuery, we used our JQuery object to get
the Window and we use the on method to then capture the resize event and
run a function. That's how we did it with JQuery.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 333.  (173) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image333.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
So here the syntax is slightly different but not that different. We're
just adding an event listener to the Window and resizing it for when we
resize. So it's not that different it's a little bit different and the
JQuery is a little bit shorter but that's okay.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 334/335.  (174) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Once we're in here, what we're going to do is we're going to use this
variable that we left up here doneResizing and we're going to say done
resizing=, yeah, I'm doing this wrong. I need to do, a clear time out.
Clear time out, done resizing. And then I need my done resizing=set
timeout.

</p>
<p>That's what we're set time out and set time out runs a function,
after comma a certain period of time, 500. This is exactly the same as
what we had before, and basically what's going to happen is this going
to capture while we're resizing. But clear time out is going to keep
keep this thing from actually doing anything until we're done resizing.
So we only want to capture this when we're done actually resizing the
Window console.log time resizing. Which will happen 500 half a second
after we're done actually resizing the Window.</p>

<p>So let's just test that really quickly over here. I'm going to
refresh the page and I'm going to click this button here to get into
resize mode and then I can resize this Window up and down and sideways
and do all this stuff, but it's not going to actually do anything until
I let go and stop resizing. In that case it'll say done resizing, at the
end of that done resizing.</p>
What am I going to put inside there, that's going to run while when I've
done resizing, I'm going to add my function. Research age position.
That's what I call it. Yeah, that's the same function we had before in
the JQuery version. So, I'm going to come down here, I'm going to have
to function reset page position () currently braces and we will go on
from there and we'll build that up in the next lesson to finish the
script off. But this is really all exactly the same as what we did in
the for the jQuery version.

  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="40%;" />
</p>
<p>We're down to the end of this lesson and we just need to fill out
this resetPagePosition function.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 339/340.  (176) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image339.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image340.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
We're going to start by coming here and copy this (left image). And
stick it in here (right image). I also want to make sure postTops gets
reassigned an empty array. Just to be absolutely certain postTops is
empty.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 341.  (177) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image341.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>And then, I'm going to go through each of my posts and push into
there, at the top of that postTops. So, that makes sure that again, if
I'm resizing my window and recapturing where the tops of each of those
sections, is because they may have changed based on how wide the window
is once I've finished resizing it.</p>
<p>The next thing I want to do, is, create a variable called
PagePosition and again set it to the window offset 250 pixels (const
pagePosition = window.pageYOffset=250). Then, I'm going to set the
counter to zero (counter=0). It has to do with this next piece of code
that we're going to write here. I want to go through the postTops array
for each. And having to run a function here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 341.  (178) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image341.webp"
  alt="."
  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius:15px"
  width="50%;" />
</p>
<p>For each of the posts that are in there, for each post in postTops,
and really, this is the actual number that represents the top of the
post. For each post, I want to do an if statement. If pagePosition is
greater than the post, that number for how far down the page that is, if
that's true then, I want to increment counter ++.</p>
<p>Now think about this for a second, pagePosition is going to be at
least 250 pixels. If I'm scrolled up at the very top of the window, it's
going to be at least 250. This first post, we know is 200. So, even if
I'm scrolled very much to the top of the window, counter is going to get
incremented from 0 to 1. If I'm in the second post, if I'm scrolled
further down and I'm in the second post, somewhere below the first post
and in the second post, then it's going to get incremented, not once but
twice. Because, it's going to go through posts each time. So, it's going
to check, is it larger than the first post? Yes. Is it larger than the
second post? Yes. So, then it's going to get incremented twice.</p>
<p>If we're scrolled further down the page inside the third post, then
this is going to go and it's going to say, am I larger than the first
post? Yes, am I larger than the second post? Yes. Am I larger than the
third post? Yes. And counter is going to get incremented to 3. So, each
time I go into a post, it's going to get incremented and then it's going
to check the fourth post. Is it larger than that? No. So, if statement
is not going to run, it's not going to get incremented. Counters can end
up being the number that matches how far down the page we are and which
post is actually showing. It's a little tricky but hopefully it makes
sense.</p>
<p>The next thing we need to do is remove the class from each link and
we did that up here. We already have that up here. This for each year.
So, I'm just going to copy that one. And come down here and paste that
in. Make sure you put it in the right place. This is closing out this
for each group here, knave links for each, I'm just going to remove the
class.</p>
<p>Once we remove the class, we're just going to do this same thing
here. So, the correct link gets highlighted. So, it's kind of a long
function, where it looks long and we could probably shorten it up. This
could all go in one line really. Kind of a long line, but not that bad.
This could probably go all in one line. You could add some comments and
you're saying exactly what does what, but that kind of shortens it up a
little bit, makes it a little bit more compact. Maybe be helpful with
some comments, I don't know.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 342/343.  (179) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image343.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
All right great. So now that we've got this, the last thing we need to
do, we're already running it, we're already running this function here.
We need to run it again up at the top of the page. And we can run it
instead of this stuff, we can get rid of this all together because we're
because this is going to include doing that, so we don't need to do that
again, we can just run it here. And that should work. Let's go over and
test it out really quickly.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Come back to my page over here and I'm going to make sure I'm
scrolled up to the very top. I'm going to refresh and then I'm going to
resize the screen. I guess I should scroll down. So, if I scroll down to
section three here and resize the screen down. When I'd done resizing,
it should give me the correct location for that. Here we go now. Section
five, there is fifth section is showing. Scale it down again. Now, I'm
in the fourth section. So, that's actually working. If I'm down the
page, say here, section three and I refresh, the third section should
come up highlighted. If I'm showing the second section and I refresh,
the second section should come up highlighted. So, this part of the
script seems to be working a little bit better without jQuery.</p>
I think the JavaScript version is a little bit smoother and a little bit
cleaner. J query sometimes with, it's just not quite as smooth as plain
JavaScript. So, I think I actually like this version of the script a
lot. This is a script you could use to do all kinds of really cool
effects based on where you're scrolling on the page and we have it both
in jQuery and in vanilla JavaScript.

</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that frequently people will use plugins to
do this kind of thing or libraries. There's some good ones out there.
There's one called Animate On Scroll. Animate On Scroll, this library
here. And you could plug this in and do some, and it gives you access to
all kinds of really cool effects that you can use while you're
animating, while you're scrolling the page. But, I think it's really
helpful to have a foundational understanding of how this kind of thing
actually works. And before just jumping into using a library or if you
want to do your own thing, I think it's helped.</p>
<p>This script is really great, and I think really you could do a lot
with it without even going to a library, like Animated On Scroll. But,
that's up to you.</p>

Scription site, part 1, building the HTML and CSS. In this lesson we're
going to look at building a web page that looks like this and it's a
long scrolling page. This page is going to have a number of interactive
elements in it. And you'll be able to use a lot of the skills you've
gained so far in this course by creating these interactive elements.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 350.  (183) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image350.webp"
  style="width:50%;"

</p>
This will be a slider using flex slider up here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 351.  (183) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image351.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Further down the page we will have tabbed interface, content rotator, so
you'll get to use some of these different scripts, including the smooth
scroll script and some of these other scripts that we've created on this
page.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 352.  (184) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image352.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>For this first lesson for building the HTML and CSS. It's not
required that you do this, you this is optional. But remember that
JavaScript and jQuery are manipulating the HTML and CSS and I think it's
to your benefit to build this page and see how the HTML and CSS come
together.</p>
We're going to put it together mostly by copying and pasting snippets,
so it won't be quite so tedious with having to type it all on one hand,
although you could type it if you really want to understand the html and
CSS, I certainly would applaud you for doing that, but it's not really
necessary. I think just by copying &amp; pasting the html in place,
you'll get a lot out of understanding how this page is built and how it
all comes together. And then you can take on the challenge of adding the
interactive elements because you'll understand how the HTML and CSS come
together.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 353/354.  (184) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image353.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
<img src="./images/webp/image354.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
We'll be copying and pasting from snippets and I have some snippets over
here so you can see that will be sort of copying and pasting these to
build up our html. I've got more snippets for the CSS so you'll see how
that all comes together. Okay so we've got that and that's really cool.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 355/356.  (185) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image355.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
<img src="./images/webp/image356.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
There are a few things to pay attention to before we really start. There
are some start files with description. Start files include the basic
html file and the CSS file, the link to an empty JavaScript file on the
html file. There are links to normalize CSS script and what that does is
it ensures that styling is the same or very similar between browsers,
normalizes the differences between different browsers.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 357.  (185) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image357.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Then you'll see that there are links to the google fonts that we're
going to use on our own style sheet. jQuery and the jQuery easing plugin
that we are already familiar and style sheet has some different sections
for different parts of the page and some media queries from screen
sizes.</p>
The site will be constructed with this mobile first approach where we'll
be adding layout for the larger screens in the media queries. The page
will be responsive but it's not RESPONSIVE.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 358/359.  (186) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image358.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
<img src="./images/webp/image359.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
You can see here is the link for the normal script and the google fonts.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 360/361.  (186) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image360.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
<img src="./images/webp/image361.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Our stylesheet, we've got links for jQuery easing and on the style sheet
we have some sections that we can put our different pieces in. So those
are all in place and ready to go along with some media queries for the
bottoms of the page and getting it all into place that way.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 362.  (187) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image362.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And then on the JavaScript we have a script file with some comments for
where you're going to put your scripts but you'll be adding that in a
later lesson for here, you're just going to build up this html and CSS.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 363.  (187) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image363.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Now we're ready to get started and the first thing we need to do is
put our basic site structure in place. So this is the basic structure of
the page. We've got a header and then we've got a dip for the slider and
then we've got a section for each part of the page as you scroll down
the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 364/365.  (188) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image364.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
<img src="./images/webp/image365.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So going back to our design here, if we look at this, you'll see up
here, this is going to be the header with the navigation. And we've got
this will be for the flex slider here and then that's a section, that's
a section, that's a section, that's a section and that's a section, so
we'll be put and then the footer. So we've got all of those pieces in
there.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 366/367.  (188) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image366.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
<img src="./images/webp/image367.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>So to get that going, we're going to start adding this HTML to our
page over here so we can go ahead and add that into our body here. Yeah,
boom, done.</p>
<p>So this is how this page is going to come together a lot of copy and
paste and you just have to be careful to paste things into the correct
place. But if you go wrong, don't worry about it at the end, I will give
you my finished file so you could do this without going through this.
But I think it's helpful to go through it anyway.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 368.  (189) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image368.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Inside the header, you're going to have a div with the logo in it and
the H 1 for the page. It's important for pages to have a main heading
because google pays a lot of attention to that.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 369/370.  (190) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image370.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And then we've got our navigation and again, this is on the snippet, so
you don't have to type it, it's all here, you just come in here and copy
this and paste it. So we're going to come over here and it's going to go
inside the header there like that. So it's all displayed properly there.
Great. So that the HTML for the header is done, we can save that and
let's see what we need to do next.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 371/372.  (190) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image371.webp"
  style="width:45%;"

</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 373.  (191) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image362.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>The HTML for the slider is set up ready for us to use flex slider.
And we'll be using the your challenge will be to implement the more
complex flex slider where you put the pictures of what's going to go on
the slide in the background and then put a div on top. So I have this
set up with just one slide so that the page looks good. But then later
you can add flex slider but you'll have the right markup in place to
make it easier to add flex slider later.</p>
So let's go ahead and take a look at how to put that in there over here.
It's on the snippets, we can just copy this piece here and then come
over to our layout, our page here and stick that stuff inside the slider
Div. There we go. Easy enough.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 374/375.  (191) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image374.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image375.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And then we've got the overview section. And there's a lot more HTML
that can be shown here on this slide. But it's all in the snippets and
basically we have an article with an H2 and some paragraphs and then
we've got a section with some articles in it. And what we're going for
is something like this, come over here and scroll up on this thing. So
we've got an article with some paragraphs in it. And then we've got a
section with some articles in it. So this section is going to come over
here and take care of that, okay?
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 376/377.  (192) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image376.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image377.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So let's go ahead and put that in. Its on the snippets. This whole big
chunk here, and you click in your to command A and command C. And then
come over to your file and that's going to go inside the overview
section, paste. There's nothing too fancy in here. There's no reason to
make you go in and type all of this. It's just articles and paragraphs
with each threes. But it's important to recognize the structure. So we
have a section that's going to have this whole thing. So we've got a
section inside of a section here. And it's important to recognize when
you're making mark up for things that you're looking at, your design and
trying to figure out. Okay, how do I need to break this down into
smaller sub pieces.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 378/379.  (193) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image378.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image379.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Next comes the download section. And again, there's more actual markup
than fits in the picture here in the right. But we've got an article
with a div and an ordered list and then we've got another article within
H3 and a div with an ordered list. And ultimately, this is an ordered
list that has the class. Each feature is going to get animated. So that
will be part of your challenge later will be to animate that annoy
ordered lists, that it works in place and I'll show you the finished
version later and how it's supposed to look. But for right now, we can
just get the markup going in place over here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 380.  (193) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image380.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>I'm going to come over here and come down and just put it all this
here. I'm just going to come in here, command A command C to copy it.
And then come back to my code and put all of that over here, and it's
going to go inside the download section here. So it's just going to go
there. Just paste it all in. Perfect. Nothing too fancy. It seems really
long. But will be this is all of our content for our page. Okay, great.
We're coming along really well here. And we'll stop this lesson here and
then we'll pick up putting in the rest of the HTML out in the next
lesson.</p>

This one is going to represent the tabs that show up in this tab section
here, and it's kind of an indicator of how powerful tabs are because
we've got content here. And then, we've got the same amount of content
in each one of these tabs, and it really adds up to a lot of content.
But when you use tabs properly, you're really reducing the cognitive
load of your user because you're not giving them all of the information
at once. And they can click on the correct tab that applies to them, and
you'll be adding that script later as part of your challenge.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 384.  (196) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image384.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>But for right now we just need to get the actual HTML in place which
I have here. I have it in pieces here. So first we'll just add the
structure for the tabs.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 385/386.  (196) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image385.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image386.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So I'm going to put this in over here. And it goes down here inside the
pricing section, Here, and each one of these tabs is going to get
content in here, so I've got tab 1, tab 2, and tab 3, and each one of
those is going to get a pile of content.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 387/388.  (197) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image387.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image388.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So if we come back here you can see this is all of the content just for
a tab 1, so I'm going to select all of this and all of this. So you have
to be really careful to put it in the right place. So here, this is all
going inside of this container for tab 1 here, so make sure you're in
the right place and paste it in there.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 389/390.  (197) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image389.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image390.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And then, scroll down and the next one is going to go here inside tab 2,
let's put that in tab 2 content, copy all of that, that's a lot of
content.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 391/392.  (198) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image391.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image392.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>And then, tap 3 content, same thing, tab that in and then come over
here and come back and grab the next pile of content for tab 3, that's a
lot of content. And tabs are really efficient at making sure you're not
showing too much content at once when they're used properly. So there we
go.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 393.  (199) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image393.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So we've got all of this stuff in here, we're already up to over 300
lines of code under HTML file. Okay great. So we've got all of our tabs
in place and then the next section we need to do, we need to work on is
the, I have their pricing section content here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 394.  (199) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image394.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And then, the listen section and this is going to get a rotator, and you
can see ID rotator. We're going to rotate block quotes. For right now,
we've just got one block quote in, but later when you make that work you
can add some more block quotes.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 395/396.  (199) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image395.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image396.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So let's come over to our snippets and here's our listen section. Yeah
and again just to go over to our design and see what that looks like.
That's this section down here, it's going to have this piece and this
piece of continue which will use our rotator content rotator to actually
rotate that around.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 397.  (200) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image397.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So you'll get lots of practice putting this together, so that's going to
go inside this listen section here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 398.  (200) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image398.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And then finally after that, we have our team which isn't too long,
that's going to be next.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 399/400.  (201) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image399.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image400.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Not quite the last thing but we'll get that next and put that in our
team.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 401/402.  (201) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image401.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image402.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>And then we'll go and get the footer content and copy that and put it
into the footer. You've probably never built an HTML page quite so fast.
And it's great to be able to copy and paste this stuff in, but I
recommend taking a few minutes to look at how the pages structured, how
the content is structured. And how the page is using best practices and
semantic markup to make sure that things that are articles are marked,
articles, things that are lists are marked lists. Headings, have the
correct headings on them have the correct levels of headings on them and
all of this kind of stuff.</p>
We want to make sure that everything is marked up properly because
Google will be looking at it and scanning it over and using this kind of
information to make your page findable. So it's really important to make
sure that you're using semantic markup properly, and with that we have
all of our HTML in place.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 403.  (202) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image403.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
If you were to come over and load up the page over here, you would see
it doesn't look very good, but it's readable, without any styling at all
you could read the page if you had to without any styling at all. And
that's kind of the purpose of semantic markup, is that if for some
reasons, the styling doesn't work or somebody's working in some real low
quality browser, the pages still readable and the information is still
accessible.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p align="center">

</p>
In the last lesson (2.31), we finished with the html, and now we are
going to start styling, and getting the styling in place.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And, I have a new set of snippets, so, you make sure you open this
because we are also going to copy, and paste the styling into place, so,
it goes fairly quickly. But hopefully you have got all of this in place.
And, what I recommend you do is we are going to do a mobile first
approach.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 407.  (203) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image407.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>What I recommend you do is right-click on the page and choose,
inspect and then make sure this little button ‘Responsive’ is toggled
here. This button when it is toggled on, you can actually set aside
through yours for your page here, and I am going to set it to like
iPhone 6, 7 and eight that seems like a good size to set to begin
with.</p>
<p>And yeah, so, there we are and hopefully that is all working well if
I got the yes, if you port things set there. Okay, good, so we should be
all set with that and from here we can go over, and start working on
some styling for the page here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 408.  (203) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image408.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Now, I have some initial basic resets. The normalized CSS helps
smooth out differences between browsers, but I have often found it
helpful to change some default styling on some elements to help speed up
development. Removing padding and margin from a bunch of elements helps
removing bullets from a new ordered lists, and ordered lists if they
happen to be inside of Nab elements often helps the asterix on the
box.</p>
<p>Sizing means that I am going to switch everything from using box
sizing, content box to box sizing border box. If you do not know the
difference between those two, I recommend that you look it up and become
familiar with it. The short answer is that in CSS when you have the
width of an element set, suppose I have a section and I set it to 500
pixels wide. If I add padding, if I had border, if I had margin it is
going to add to the width of that element. The 500 pixels is the width
of the content. So, when we switch it to box sizing border box, when I
set the width of the elements of 500 pixels that will include the
padding, and the border, not just the content. And, so that is usually
pretty helpful to have set, and we will just set it that way for
everything for images.</p>
I am going to set the max within those 200, and I like to set them to
display block images by default are in line elements, but we rarely use
them in line. So, I think it is helpful to set them to display block. I
am also going to get rid of the ugly underlines on links. I do not
really like the way they look all style weeks differently, and I am
using some variables for the colors of the page. So, if you wanted to
change the colors of the page, you could just change them here once and
it will change it throughout the, throughout the whole page.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 409.  (203) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image409.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
If we come over and look at the design here, you can see if I move up
over here that I have got. This is the color scheme that I am working
with. I created a color scheme. So, these are the colors that I am
actually working with to create all of my colors on the page. And, it is
helpful when you are designing to start with the color scheme, you may
not stick with it exactly, but it is helpful to do that.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 410/411.  (2) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image410.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image411.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>All right, so you can come over to our snippets here, and copy this
first snippet which has all the basic styling on it, and paste it in
over here on our style sheet.</p>
<p>We are going to start working on the stylesheet, and I am going to go
all the way up to the top, and put this stuff into the basics reset
section here, save that. And, visual studio code does not like my
shorthand styling for things, which drives me nuts, but I have yet to
figure out how to get it to not do this. So, I really prefer it not to,
but that is okay.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 412.  (203) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image412.webp"
  style="width:50%;"

</p>
It is fine, it will space everything out a little bit further and, it is
always a good idea each step along the way to come back, and see how
this is affecting the look of our page, and already it is already kind
of affecting the look of our page. It is making it look worse, and
generally reset to do. They will make your page look worse, because you
are taking styling out, you are resetting it to a basic, and then you
are going to add more styling back to make it look better. All right,
there we are with the resets.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 413/414.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image413.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image414.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 415.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image415.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>That is great, next, we can add some basic typography. Again, I am
using some google fonts, and they are loaded already in the html. They
are loading from google, and setting some color some sizes, and that
kind of stuff. And, you will see that this will quickly start to bring
some life, and breathe some life back into the page as we had this stuff
back in.</p>
So, let us go over to our snippets and add these rules here, and there's
more than what I showed on the pages. Rules for the footer, and for the
button as well. So, we will add those in under basic typography. And, I
do like to do things in this order, where I sort of set some basic
settings for the page basic resets typography and maybe some, basic page
section stuff. That is going to get inherited across the entire page.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 416.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image416.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Let us go take a look at what that looks like, those rules applied.
Boom, already starting to look a little bit better once we get a font in
there, and some and some stuff working along and going along, that is
great. All right, we will continue with the styling in the next
lesson.</p>
<h2 name="ch2-33">
2.33 Styling That Attaches to Whole Page (5:03)
</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 417.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image417.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Next, we'll apply some styling that will attach to the whole page and
there's just a few rules here, but they'll actually make quite a big
difference.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 418/419.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image418.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image419.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So let's go over and grab these three rules.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 420.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image420.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Paste them on our style sheet here inside the basic sections section.
And you'll see just with these little bit of rules over here, it's going
to make a big difference. Currently, we've got no padding here,
everything's running right up against the edge, it's kind of a mess. It
doesn't look that great yet, but I'm going to scroll up to the top here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 421.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image421.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And if I refresh, you'll see immediately we're starting to get some
spacing between the sections and a little bit more. It's getting a
little bit better, a little bit more readable coming along. And as you
work down the page, starting with these basic sections and stuff further
down the page is inherits, then you need fewer and fewer rules as you go
down the page. You'll see as it sort of works out that way.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 422/423.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image422.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image423.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Headers are always a pain in the neck. They always have a lot of styling
in them to kind of get things to look right. And sort of copy all of
this stuff and I'm going to go ahead and paste that in the header and
they had her section year.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 424/425.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image424.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image425.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>There's a lot to look at in these header styles so it's worth
spending a few minutes on this. I changed my background color for that
for my head are here to a great, but you could try a different
background color. This is one of my other colors with some transparency.
2.75 gives it a little bit of transparency, but you could own comment
this out if you wanted to see how it looks.</p>
<p>The header is going to be set to position fixed so that the header
stays up at the top of the page no matter what as you scroll down the
page. And then setting the top 0 and left 0, and then with 100% and I'm
making sure it stays on top of the z-index at the dent.</p>
<p>The logo is going to be set to position relative because I'm going to
do some absolute positioning for the H1 inside that logo down there, so
that's such a relative positioning margin. Auto is going to center that
give it a width and set the margin on the bottom.</p>
When you hover over the logo, it's going to turn the pointer to a cursor
because ultimately that's going to be a link, something that we can
click on. And it's going to activate a smooth scroll effect that you'll
put in later when you're completing the interactive challenges part of
this lesson. But you can see basically everything's kind of coming into
place here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 426.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image426.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
I've got the the rules for the navigation in here we're displaying. It
is flex, a display method that allows you to get things to line up next
to each other in a row, which is what we want for our navigation. And
then the anchor tags are set to display block. And that's because anchor
tags by default, in line elements and usually in navigation you want
them to be block elements and then I'm setting my colors and my font
size and that kind of fun stuff.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 427.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image427.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So with all that in place, we should go over and take a look and see
what all this magic does to the head header of our of our page here.
Boom, look at that, all that styling, got that all into place. The
navigation could maybe be a little bit better for mobile. I'm kind of
squeezing it all in here. You could replace it and put a hamburger menu
and have a drop down menu. But that's a lot more work and I wanted to
make the project feel a little bit, otherwise it was going to be a lot
of work if I added that for you and I didn't want to do that. But you'll
notice now the header is fixed so the header will stay there as I scroll
down the page and if you wanted to try the greenish background, you can
put that in if you wanted to. I kind of liked the gray in the end. I
kind of liked it that way. All right, so the headers in place and we're
ready to see what we need to do for the next section.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch2-34">

<p align="center">

<p align="center">

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image432.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Let's go ahead, come down here, and add this. I'm just going to copy all
of this, select it all, copy it, and then come over and add this into
the section for the slider here. There's a lot going on here, and if
you're not that familiar with CSS, I recommend poking around with this.
What happens if you remove some of these declarations? And see how it
looks, see how it changes it. The angle brackets ( ‘&gt;’) here indicate
that I'm applying this to the direct child. This makes sure that if I
have another div that's further down the chain, that it doesn't get that
styling attached to it. But the best thing to do if you're not really
sure about how this is working is to mess around with it, play around
with the settings. Even if you screw it up entirely, you can just delete
it, and then paste it back in again from the snippets. Don't worry about
messing it up. With that in place, let's go see if our slider is
displaying properly.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 433/434.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

</p>
<p>There we have it. For the mobile version, we're going to have this
called action stretch across the entire slide. It'll look better for the
desktop version because you saw over here it's going to look a little
bit different.</p>
When we get to desktop, it's going to look like this instead. I've left
off this thing, I've actually decided to put that in. But it's going to
look like this with our called action here instead. We've got that in
place and we're ready to go on to the next part.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 435.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image435.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
We don't need to do much for the overviews settings because a lot of it
is set nicely already by the styles we've already added. This is what I
meant by, as you go down the page, you need to do less styling, because
a lot of things get inherited. We just need a few rules to sort out some
of these things, and set the the overview section to display the grid,
so that it looks right there.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 436/437.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image436.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image437.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and add these rules for the overview section. Just a
few of them here. We just need to stick in over here inside the
overview. I'm going to save that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 438.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image438.webp"

</p>
Then when we come back and refresh the page. We've got our description
and we've got an overview here with our columns of stuff. It looks
really good, it looks really nice. You can imagine seeing this on your
phone, it should look pretty nice. Again, we're doing the mobile first,
because we'll be adding the desktop view in later. Then next, we've got
to look at the desktop, the download section.

Download styles, let's add those. There are a lot of rules for the
download section. Some of these are specifically in place because of the
JavaScript you'll be adding later. Again, I recommend adjusting the
settings and removing declarations to see what happens. Only a few of
the roles are shown over here, but I've got a lot more on here. There's
a whole big chunk for the download section. It's a lot. Let's just grab
it all. Again, the best thing to do is to mess with it, and see what
happens if you mess around with it. If you screwed up, just paste it
back in again, it's not a big deal.

<p align="center">

We put that in. I'm not going to go through and describe all of these,
but they're all in here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p align="center">

Let's go take a look and see what that did to our page. Download
section. This thing here is going to be an element. I'll show you the
finished version that animates, and moves these things up and down, or
moves them up into place, and highlight them as they go by. You'll be
adding that scripture, you'll have a challenge to add that script on
your own in a future lesson here. Great, we're coming along.

<p align="center">

<p>We're going to continue adding styling to our page and the next
section is the pricing styles.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%;"

</p>
<p>And that's going to set us up to get our tabs working the way we need
them to work when we add the the tapped script later, you'll be able to
add that later to make that work. So most of that content is going to be
hidden because we're only showing the first tab and the other tabs are
going to be set to display none.</p>
There's only a few of the rules shown here, but there's a lot more over
here on the snippets down your pricing section styles, you can see
there's a big old chunk of styles here. And again, if you're not sure
what these do recommend playing around with them and inspecting your
page, take something out, see what happens, change the values mess
around with it. It doesn't matter if you screwed up, it's totally fine.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 446/447.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image446.webp"

  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image447.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>I'm going to go ahead and add those here under the pricing style
section, And you'll see once we get that in and save it and then come
back here and refresh the page. I'm going to scroll down to the pricing
section here and click refresh and just like magic.</p>
Look at that, we have a tabbed interface. These tabs don't work because
we haven't done anything with them yet. And now we're I'm getting those
things up there in the header, I don't really want those there. But
we'll get that to work later, that would be great if we get that to
work. But we've got all of that content designed and looking pretty
good. Now, we just need to go on to the next section.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 448/449.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Let's get these styles for the listen section. It's not that many here,
it's just a few. We'll add more, you'll add some more later. When you do
the JavaScript to make the actual content rotator work, we'll add a few
more, but we'll get those into place and then let's come back over here.
And put these in just to kind of get that to display properly, save
that.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 450.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image450.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And then let's take a look and see how that is actually coming through.
Refresh this scroll down and here's our listen section, looks nice for
mobile.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 451/452.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image451.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image452.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Next, we've got the our team section, let's go ahead and add that. There
isn't going to be any interactive elements for the rest of the page.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 453/454.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image453.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image454.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So these styles will just stay the way they are and we're not going to
do anything interactive with these last two sections, there our team
part and the footer. And again, if you're not sure what these rules are
doing or recommend playing around with them, take some time with it to
see what they actually do, save that. Let's come back and see how the
rest of our page shapes up.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 455/456.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image455.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image456.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
There's the our team section for mobile and the footer and now we've got
the entire mobile version of this page set. The next thing we need to do
is, add will adjust styling in the media queries for when the page gets
larger, so we'll do that next.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch2-36">
2.36 Tablet Styles (6:46)
</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 457.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image457.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
You've finished the styling for the mobile version, and now it's time to
get the styling in place for the tablet version.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 458/459.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image458.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image459.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So to get ready for that, come over here to your view, switch this to be
responsive and make the screen just a little bit larger than 670 pixel
over here. I've forgotten now, 760 pixels. Honestly, I probably could do
a little bit more for the styling in between these sizes, somewhere in
61, sure, that's fine. But at this point, we're getting to a point where
our layout just doesn't look quite as good at this size, we could do a
better job.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 460/461.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image460.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image461.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>We can add a media query, adjust our layout a little bit based on the
size here. Again, we'll just copy and paste our styles in place so you
can get a sense of how that could work. Once you've got that set up,
let's go in and add some styles for immediate query. Again, Visual
Studio is going to mess up my formatting for these, but that's okay.
When I'm putting stuff inside the media, I like things to line up all in
one long line rather than to expand the output visuals to you. It's not
going to cooperate with me in that, but that's okay.</p>
So I'm going to add 760 media query styling for the slider and for the
overview to make those two areas look a little bit better.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 462.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image462.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
I'm going to copy that. Come over here and scroll down and you can see I
have a media query here for 760 pixels, so these rules are going to go
between these two curly braces in here. I'm going to paste those in, and
even tap them in a little bit there. When I click save, it's going to
expand more, which drives me nuts, but that's right.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 463.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image463.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>But if I come back and look at that, if I come back here and refresh
up at the top of my page, you'll see it's adjusted this down here, it's
made some adjustments to this area. Basically, what I'm doing here is
I'm just overriding some of the styles that are up above with some
slightly new versions, set overview to display Fleck's, for example, so
that I can get this entire section here, so I can get this card sitting
next to these columns rather than just one column. By the time I get to
760 pixels, I've got enough room for some additional columns.</p>
It's a lot easier to add layout as the screen gets wider than it is to
take it away as the screen gets smaller. So that's where we start with
mobile first, is that we can easily just add layer by just tying this
section to the split flex and just add a few rules to add some layout as
the screen gets wider.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 464/465.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image464.webp"

</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 466.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image466.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Okay, great. we've got that into place. I have a few more rules for the
download and pricing style sections. Again, they're just giving me some
lay up by satting display, flex and flex wrap, setting the article to
flex 1, just giving me some layout since I've got enough screen space to
do it here. All of these are actually just providing a little bit of
layout using the flex parts model here, flex parts layout model. Again,
these are going to go into the 760 media query.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 467.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image467.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So just after these rules here, but this is the closing of the media
career, that curly brace, don't lose that. It can screw things up, it
goes after that one. I wish that it didn't. Do this thing where it piles
them all up. In fact, I'm going to leave those like that and not save it
until we and get the next set, which is for the lesson and our team.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 468/469.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image469.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Then we'll do a few minor changes for the footer as well. So it's great
to put all of these in. Again, if you're not sure what these do, I
really recommend coming in and messing around with them, see what they
do when you take them out, see what happens.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 470/471.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
We got that and then we've got the ones for the footer as well.
Hopefully, and I realized that by copying and pasting the stuff in you
probably just copying and pasting without really understanding and
following along. But hopefully, some of this sinks in a little bit in
terms of seeing the page come together so that when you start doing the
interaction design stuff, it'll make more sense. That's my hope. But if
it doesn't feel like it seems like it's doing that and that's fine, you
could skip to the end. I will provide this file before you're finished
when we're done.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

</p>
You can see I've added a little bit of layout here. Down here, I have
added a little bit lay. Pricing is over here and my tabs are on this
side instead of one on top of the other.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 474.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

here which will use content rotator for.

</p>
Your team has been reconfigured to make that look a little bit better,
and in the footer set up to look a little bit better. By the way, in the
footer, I have the names of all the different people who provided these
images taken off on splash. Great, we've got the 760 media query done,
let's go ahead next and work on the next media query for the full
desktop size.

</p>
<p>When I get my screen that wide, I want to make further adjustments to
the layout. And we're really getting much closer to the design that you
saw over here on my Adobe XD file. At that point I have one more but
plan, we're getting a lot closer to that.</p>
So come over to your thing here and set this so that it's 1020 pixels
wide or a little bit wider and I might need to move my with this thing
down or maybe make this a little bit smaller here. 1020 1021 that's
plenty. There we go. At this point, like if you look at this, the visual
relationships just aren't as good as they could be. Like this is too
wide in here, I've got too much space in here and this is kind of
scrunched in year now. This is where I want to make some adjustments
here to this looks kind of funny, maybe it's narrow enough and wide
enough now that I can get all these three things kind of in a row here.
So, we just want to make some adjustments to how these different
elements layout and the space available for them to make them look a
little bit better. And this is all just part of what you do as a
designer.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>I'm going to come in here, I'm going to grab these rules here for the
body, the header and the slider styles just got some basic styling
changes that I want to make happen here and we will put those inside of
the large tablet size 1020 pixels. Stick them in there.</p>
Okay that's going to take care of those elements the body, the header
and the slider. I'll get slightly different layout different, slightly
different padding, you can tell all this stuff has to do pretty much
with layout with 33% padding 30. It's all having things to do with
layout in here that I'm applying to these elements. And again, if you
want to mess around with it, feel free.

This one is the listen and teams. You don't need to do anything for the
footer. It'll just get wider. Listen styles tab those in. Now when I say
this is all going to get expanded sadly, but there we go. Maybe like
reading it that way for the media queries. I like them all in one line.
I find it there's usually just one or two declarations. Not that much
going on. This one had more, but I prefer to put them on one line.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 486/487.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

</p>
<p>Let's go take a look and see what all that did for our 1020 version
of our page refresh. Now, this is now taking up a third of the width of
the page. My logo's over here. My navigation is lined up down here. The
spacing looks nicer for this down here. This is all in one line, like I
was mentioning before, that makes sense. This is all set and ready to be
animated, which is kind of cool over here, we've got less space for this
thing and more space for the tabs makes sense now that we've got more
room for that. It's just a matter of coming up with the right
proportions down here. This has been made smaller and this takes up more
space in the size of the font has been adjusted. This is looking
slightly different with the picture over here now, so that's all-in-one
row and the footer stays the same. There we go.</p>
The 1020 media query is done and our page is really coming together. I'm
going to look at the next one in the next lesson.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch2-38">
2.38 Media Query for 1200 Pixels Wide
</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 488.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image488.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
The media query for 1200 pixels wide is for when somebody is viewing
this website on a nice large desktop in their browsers, nice and wide,
and they've got lots of screen real estate, in which case we can really
kind of optimize our layout for that look.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 489.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image489.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So let's go ahead and add these rules in over there and you need to set
your width here for me to do it.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 490.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image490.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
I'm going to need to move this thing down to the bottom here and I'm
going to shrink that down a little bit. And then set this to 1200, maybe
1201 like that, because now I've got a lot of room so I can really do
some nice stuff here. I'm going to put these into three columns instead
of two. This is too wide over here, I can shrink that one down, just
make minor changes in here. Some of them don't need much, this one
doesn't need a lot of change, but just making some minor changes to kind
of make the stuff look a little bit better on the wider screen. So let's
go over and add those rules that we have on our snippets and they're
here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 491/492.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image491.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image492.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
I want to cut this set first. I'm giving sections 50 pixels padding, so
now I've got a lot of room, I can actually space things out, give them a
little bit of room to breathe, all that kind of stuff. It all just has
to do with providing some better spacing in here, and when you're a
designer, spacing is really important because it really helps
communicate. So you want to get that kind of stuff just right as much as
possible.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 493/494.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image493.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image494.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And then we've got a few more here for the overview, download and
pricing styles. I want to switch to here and add those in. Again, the
angle brackets are there to make sure that only articles that are direct
descendant of the overview section. So it won't apply to an article
inside of an article, it will only apply to those parent level ones, and
that's kind of helpful to be aware of.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 495/496.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image495.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image496.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Okay, continue on here and get the last piece for this one. And finally,
put that in here. The footer gets some new styling at 1200 pixels to
adjust for that.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 497/498.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image498.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And then finally, we've got one little rule that goes in the 1500 or
larger media query, and it has to do with the fact that the header is
set to fixed positioning, but I want to make sure it gets centered in
the screen. If my screen is larger than 1500 pixels, which would be
really large, and I can't even demonstrate that here in this lesson, but
you'll have to trust me that it works. Or try it out or if you've got a
nice big monitor you'll see the difference. Take it out and see what it
looks like without it and then put it back in.

</p>
So now I've got that all sort of sorted out. And in there, I can come
over and take a look at my page. You can see this got reconfigured even
smaller to fit a little bit better. Down here, I've given 50 pixels
padding on the edges, 50 pixels padding. I've got some room here. It's
nice to have some room. And so since I've got some room, I might as well
use it to give myself some white space, make the page a little bit
easier to read, make it a little bit nicer.

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Down here, again, adding some room, 50 pixels padding around these
things. 50 pixels padding around this element here. Give it a little bit
of breathing room.</p>
Same thing down here. Now I've got some extra padding in here. Give it a
little bit of breathing room, extra padding here to give it a little bit
of breathing room.

</p>
<p>I bumped up the sizing of this quote a lot. I mean, really make it
stand out. I got the room now, might as well, right? Down here, the team
hasn't changed too much, just some extra spacing there, and then the
footer got cleaned up with a little bit of extra room and kind of
cleaning that up.</p>
And now we have the entire style of the entire page put into place, and
hopefully, it came together. Okay, for you, I recommend playing around
with it, seeing what sort of different kinds of things you can do with
it. You can always come back to my version. I will give you this version
as something that you can download and so you can get my version anyway,
so there's no reason why you shouldn't play around with this and mess
around with it, come up with your own styling and see what you can do
with it. It's always fun to do that.

2.39 Scription Site: Building Interactive Elements Challenges

</p>
In the previous lesson, we did the HTML and CSS to create this fictional
web page for scription, and this fictional company, and it looks really
nice, and I hope you like it and perhaps you did this or perhaps you're
working with my files, and either way, you've got a nice foundation on
which you can actually build in some interactive elements. This is your
opportunity to show all the great things you've learned in our
JavaScript specialization and to do some challenges to build some
interactive elements in here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 506.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image506.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Let's take a look at what some of these different interactive elements
are. If I come over to this tab here and I will provide this page for
you, so that you can see what you're supposed to be doing.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 507.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image507.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Here I have the scription web site with all of the interactive elements
put in it. You can see that it's got a flex slider and it's running and
doing its thing and it's functional, and you can click on the different
links here, different pieces here. It's stuff set that up, so that's all
working.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 508.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image508.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
You'll notice that I've got a nice, smooth scroll script working here
and it moves down to each section as we go down here, when we get down
to the download section.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 509/510.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Of all of the challenges, this is the toughest one, because this is the
one that doesn't match exactly what we've done in the other lessons,
you're going to have to figure out this one on your own. These list of
items moves up and pops into place and highlights the top item. To give
you a sense of all the features this piece of software has to offer over
here, this would be a lesson, but it's really just a picture of a
lesson. No big deal.

</p>
<p>We go into pricing, and sure enough, you have tabs, you know how to
make a tabs interface, you do it with JQuery, you do it with JavaScript,
either one. I leave it up to you to choose which one you want to use.
Tabs interface.</p>
Turn to the listen section (right). You will see that we have the
content rotator, you know how to put any content rotator. We've done
that script. It's your job to add all of these scripts together to make
them all look right on the page. Our team doesn't have anything
interactive on it and the footer doesn't, but we can go all the way back
up to the top of the page by clicking the logo. These are all of the
pieces for you to build in, and it should be pretty fun.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 513.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image513.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Let's take a quick look at the challenges as they're laid out here.
We've got all of that done, and that's our introduction, we want to make
sure that you link to a script file to make sure there are no variables
in the global scope, so each script needs to be in IIFE closure or some
other function that will keep the variable from creeping into the global
scope.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 514.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image514.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
The first challenge is the smooth scroll. Again, when the user clicks
the links in the navigation, it should scroll to the correct point on
the page. In addition, when the user clicks on a logo, it should scroll
to the very top of the page. See if you can figure it out. It's just a
very small change from what we've done in the past with the smooth
scroll script. It's really just the easy part of the smooth scroll
script where it's scrolling down to the correct part of the page, we're
not doing any of the page tracking stuff that was much harder. So that's
challenge one.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 515.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image515.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Some hints for this, see if you can modify the JQuery smooth scroll
script from the first lesson module to make it work. You might find it
easiest to use two click handlers, one that targets the links in the
navigation and one that targets the logo. I also made the animation feel
snappy. I set it at 600 milliseconds and I used the easeinCirc
easing.</p>
<p>The easing plugin is already included on the page, so you don't even
have to add that. Be sure to put the entire script inside of an IIFE,
immediately invoked function expression so that no variables end up in
the global scope.</p>
Also, make sure that all the variables are declared with either const or
let const as preferred only use let if the value of the variable needs
to change in the course of writing the script, and the way to do that is
just to set everything to const and then if it breaks, find which one is
breaking and change that one to let. Usually it's const.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 516.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image516.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Challenge 2, add the Flexslider. For this challenge, turn the image at
the top of the page into a flexslider. To do this, go back to the
Flexslider lesson for a reminder on how the Flexslider works. Add the
link to the Flexslider the CSS to the index file at the markup for the
additional slides, the index file. By the way, I've provided some
additional snippets so that adding this markup will be easier.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 517.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image517.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Here are all the list items that you need for the Flexslider and I
will provide this file for you so you can just paste this right in. You
don't have to do a lot of tedious typing and all that stuff, which is
what I did when I made this. I'm saving you the pain that I went through
by providing you with these snippets. You'll add the additional markup,
add the link to the Flexslider JS script to the bottom of the index
file. I provided with this lesson, again, the download for the
Flexslider's files. You'll need those in order to make this work.</p>
Adjust the styling in the CSS file and add appropriate script to the JS
file to initialize the slider. I did modify the slider a little bit with
some of the features that we saw in the other slider.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 518.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image518.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Notice that I also got rid of the arrows that point left and right.
That's a setting, so you can just turn them off by just setting it to
false. I got rid of that because they look okay on the desktop version,
although they don't really go with the style of the site. But they
really look terrible on the mobile version. I decided I didn't want them
anymore. I didn't really need that particular item in there. I did that
as well.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 519.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image519.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Once you get the Flexslider done, you can go on to, Challenge 3, add
the tabs. For this challenge add the script to make the tabs work in the
pricing section. You need to learn how to make the tabs. In the second
course, you learned how to make the tabs earlier on in this course and
in the previous course.</p>
The only real adjustments you need to make to the jQuery, of the
JavaScript for this version of the script is the background color
settings. Other than that, it's really a copy and paste of the script.
You could use the plain JS version of the script. You could use that
version but if you do, you'll need to add a few styles to the
style-sheet to make that version work and you can go back and look at
that version of that script to see what styles you would need to add.
That's Challenge 3, to get that to work.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 520.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image520.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Challenge 4, is the content rotator. Add the content rotator for the
client quotes to this challenge. To do this, you'll need to add more
markup for the additional quotes which are provided in the snippets. You
also need to modify the script so that they're rotating block quotes
instead of paragraphs. You'll also need to add these two rules to the
style-sheet in the listen section, set their rotator min-height, and set
the block-quote to display none initially so they don't come up showing
at all.</p>
Also, in the 1020px style-sheet, you'll change the min-height for the
rotator to 550 pixels. Once you get those pieces in place, you can go
ahead and work on the content rotator. You can pause this lesson here,
we'll come back to it to see exactly what you need to do in order to get
that to work.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 521.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image521.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Challenge 5, this is really the toughest challenge because you have
not seen this one before. But you have all of the pieces you need in
order to make the script work, so see if you can do it, see if you can
figure it out from scratch. Check out how the feature is supposed to
work by looking at the finished example and see if you can make the
element function.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to write the script. You can either use the
set-interval method or you could use set-timeout and recursion. You
might also find the clone method helpful and ultimately that's what I
did. When the page loads, I make a copy of that unordered list that is
rotating into place. I clone it and put it at the bottom and then I move
them both up together. When the top one moves off the screen, I remove
it and then clone it at the bottom. This is very similar to what we did
in our own spider script that we wrote with jQuery. It's a very similar
technique. See if you can make it work. With that, I'll let you go
forward and see what you can do with this and I hope you post on the
discussion boards what you found successful and help out others who are
working on this project. Hopefully, it's a lot of fun.</p>

Hello, welcome to the third module and our third course on JavaScript.
In this module, we're going to introduce objects and we'll do a lot of
practice with them so you can get good at the syntax, and get
comfortable with working with them. Plus, we're going to introduce a
game that we're going to work on in our fourth module, and see how we
can take a more complex script and break it down. It's really
interesting content and I think you're going to get a lot out of it. I
look forward to doing it with you. Let's get started.

3.02 Introduction to Objects and Data in JS (5:52)

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 523.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image523.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Let's talk about a few of the familiar pieces we have with the
JavaScript language.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 524.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image524.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>You're already familiar with variables. That's a data structure that
can hold a variable. We have the var cheese and it can hold a value like
yummy or we have an array, that's another data structure that we're
familiar with. And an array can have, here we have var animals and it
can have several animals in the array. So we're familiar with those in
JavaScript.</p>
<p>One thing the JavaScript does not have is associative arrays. Other
languages, some languages like PHP have associative arrays. And an
associative array as seen above is an array that has a key value pair
for each element of the array. So we have a variable person and in PHP
recognized variable because it starts with the dollar sign. But we have
variable <b>person</b> and it's an array, and in the array we have key
value pairs. The key is <b>firstname</b> and the <b>lastname</b> is and
then there's the <b>firstname</b> value which is John. And then we have
another key which is <b>lastname</b>, which has the value Smith in
there. Well we can do the same thing with JavaScript but not with the
arrays. Instead we'll use <b>objects</b>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 525.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image525.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>This is the object literal in JavaScript. Here I have a variable
person and it's assigned an object, and the object consists of key value
pairs. Sometimes these are referred to as members and sometimes they're
referred to as properties. The <b>firstname</b> property of
<b>person</b> where the <b>lastname</b> property of <b>person</b>. And
then <b>firstname</b> has a value which is John and the <b>lastname</b>
is a value which is Smith. And <b>age</b> another property with the
value of 25.</p>
<p>The way you would access these in JavaScript is typing the name of
the variable <b>person</b> and then a period or dot and then the key,
the property first name. And that will give you the value John.
Frequently you'll see <b>objects</b> organized like this. <b>var
person</b> and then you'll have the <b>firstname</b> on its own line.
The first each member of the object, each key value pair. Each property
will have a line inside the object. And notice that <b>firstname</b>
doesn't have quotes around it and but John does. And this is how you
will frequently see <b>objects</b> listed in JavaScript is in this sort
of format, because it's easier to read.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 526.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image526.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Now notice here again, I'm going to point this out because this is
really important. The key in the object first name does not get quotes
around it, but the value does unless the value is a number like 25.
Here, we have aged 25, and JavaScript knows what a 25 is. The other
thing to notice here is that each key value pair is followed by a comma
except for the last one. And that's really kind of important as well. So
you'll have key value pairs and one on each line, one key value pair in
each line followed with a comma.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 527.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image527.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Now it's really important to get in the habit of actually typing
this. And to do this now just to demonstrate, you could come over to a
new browser tab, open up, choose, inspect, right? Click and choose
inspect and open up your console log here, you get to the console log
here. And the practice typing this var person equals Jose and that goes
in quotes. And it's really important to type this and to do this even
with these very basic exercises, just because the way you learn
JavaScript is by actually typing it.</p>
You're not going to learn it unless you actually type it and really see
and feel and get some muscle memory in around the actual syntax. And
then we have a comma there and then age 25 or whatever you want to put
in for an age. And remember that one does not get a comma, we just close
the object and that object has been defined.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 528.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image528.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And now I could access person.firstname and you can see it even fills it
out for me, I can press tab and it'll return Jose. You want to practice
this as much as you can, and get used to using these data structures.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 529.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image529.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>One more thing about objects before we close out this lesson is that
you can also create an object like this. Here I have person, a variable
person and I've assigned it using the new keyword, new object with a
capital O. And that will create a new object. And then I can create
members of that object very easily by just typing person dot and then a
key like first name and then assign it a value like so. And you can
create objects this way, but it's much more common to see them created
the other way using the object literal. It's shorter syntax, is a little
bit easier to follow, but you can create objects this way as well.</p>

3.03 Objects Can Contain Arrays and Other Objects (5:04)

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image530.webp"

</p>
The object data format in JavaScript is very flexible because objects
can contain arrays and other objects.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 531.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image531.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Here you can see we have an object called person and we've expanded
it a bit so it has first name and last name, but it also has an array
for pets. So, pets is holding a value that's an array. It has another
object as a member of this object. The phone number is an object, so
it's an object inside of an object and inside phone number it has its
own key value pairs. And then we can access these different values
through similar methods that we used before down here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 532.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image532.webp"
  style="width:50%;"

</p>
<p>I recommend typing this out and seeing if you can get it to work
exactly the way this works. I'm going to do that over here and you're
not going to have to watch me type it out because that's kind of
painful. I'm just going to paste it in here. But you can see I've
created this object and now I could access elements of this object by
doing <b>person.firstname</b> or <b>person.pets</b> square bracket two.
Well get me a chicken, <b>person.pets[2]</b>. It gets me the chicken or
I could do a <b>person.phonenumber</b> and then within phone number I
could have work (<b>person.phonenumber.work</b>) and that will get me
the work phone number. We can access all the data inside of this
object.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 533.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image533.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>You can even update data very easily with this and we'll talk more
about this later but it's possible to update data if I did
<b>person.firstname</b> equals Jose. I need to go in quotes So you can
now see that person. If I just do person you'll see I get the whole
object here and that first name is set to Jose. So we can actually work
with the data inside the object and we can update it or we can access
the data that's inside the object and the object can have other objects.
It can have a raise. All kinds of fun stuff can go in there and that's a
really important thing to understand about objects as a data structure.
They're very flexible and very useful for working with in this way.</p>

</p>
<p>Another thing that's interesting about objects is that they can
contain functions as one of the values of one of their properties and
that may seem like a weird thing, but remember in JavaScript functions
are first class. So wherever you can put data you can put a
function.</p>
<p>Here you can see I have an object for a <b>person</b> with
<b>firstname</b> and <b>lastname</b>. And then I have a <b>greeting</b>
which is a function which has a value, which is a <b>function()</b>. And
the function, all that function does is <b>console.log(“Hello!”)},</b>
it doesn't do anything very interesting, but we can access that value.
We can access that function by doing <b>person.greeting();</b> and then
putting the parentheses after greeting after that property. And it will
run that function that's in that assigned to that greeting key there. So
let's do this really quickly because this is kind of interesting.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 535.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image535.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
If you come back over here to your tab, we can clear out the
<b>console</b> here and I'm just going to paste this in just so that
it's there and it's all all done. But now I could type
<b>person.greeting();</b> and you can see I get hello. So it's actually
running this <b>function</b>, this anonymous <b>function</b> that's
assigned to <b>greeting</b> here. And remember when we put a
<b>function</b> as a member of an <b>object</b>, this <b>hello
function</b> belongs to <b>person</b>. Remember what we call that,
that's called a <b>method</b>. So, it's really kind of amazing that you
can assign a <b>method</b>, creative <b>function</b>, create a
<b>method</b> that belongs to an <b>object</b> and then access that
<b>method</b> through the <b>object</b>, like this
<b>person.greeting</b>. And that's a really cool feature of JavaScript
in <b>objects</b>.

<p>Let's take this idea a little bit further.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 537.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>We can put <b>functions</b> inside <b>objects</b>, which again are
called <b>methods</b>. But also we can use the <b>‘this’</b> keyword, to
reference other <b>objects</b> or other <b>keys</b> within the
<b>object</b>. And that's pretty handy, this can be pretty helpful from
time to time. So, here we have <b>person</b> and we have a property
called <b>firstname</b>, which has a value, John a property called
<b>lastname</b>, which has a value Smith and a property called
<b>greeting</b> that holds a <b>function</b>. And this function is going
to just do a <b>console.log</b>, but the <b>console.log</b> is going to
say hello this dot <b>firstname</b>. So that's going to go into the
<b>firstname</b> property and get the value and put it there. And this
dot <b>lastname</b> so that's going to go into the last new property and
get its value and put it there. So, we should get hello John Smith out
of this. And, the “<b>this</b>” keyword can be somewhat confusing in
javascript, but it refers to this <b>object</b>, this <b>person</b>,
that's the context in which this makes sense here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 538.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image538.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>So, let's give this a try over here. And it will say hello John
Smith. This is referring to this <b>firstname</b> and this
<b>lastname</b>. And remember that this is a key word here in
javascript, so that's important.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 539.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image539.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
The next thing to talk about is the <b>object constructor</b>. This will
push our <b>objects</b>, even further into something even more useful.
And what an <b>object constructor</b> does, is it creates a <b>use
function</b> to create an <b>object</b> that could be like a reusable
template that you could use over and over again.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 540. objects can contain functions (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image540.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Objects can contain functions." />
</p>
<p>
So here, if you look at this, what we have here on this screen, we have
a <b>function</b> <b>person</b>, and when you create <b>constructive
functions</b>, the standard is to make the first letter of the name of
that constructor a capital letter. So it's a person with a capital P.
And we're going to pass in some values first, <b>last age</b> and <b>eye
color</b>. And you could have other values if you wanted to as well.
<b>Height, weight, hair color</b>, I don't know whatever other things
you want to use to describe that person and notice we're using the this
keyword.
</p>
<p>
This, dot <b>firstname</b> creates a <b>firstname</b>, <b>property</b>
on <b>person</b> and it's going to be assigned whatever gets passed in,
as the value for first when the <b>object</b> is in and the same thing
for <b>lastname</b>, <b>age</b> and <b>eyecolor</b>. So, let's give this
a try to see how it works and recommend, typing this out because we're
starting to have seen a number of different ways of using objects now
and if you're not typing them, you're not going to get comfortable with
them or remember them.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 541.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image541.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
I'm going to go over here to my tab here, and I'm just going to paste it
in but you should definitely type it. Type this whole thing out here.
And once I put this in here and press return, or enter on my keyboard, I
can then make a copy of this person used this as a template. So I could
say something like, bar my mother, and I can assign it using the new
keyword new person noticed with the capital P. And then in here I'm
going to put in, <b>firstName</b> ''Mary'', <b>lastName</b> “Mead”,
<b>age</b> 60, and then <b>eyeColor</b> “brown”. Now I have a copy of
this <b>object</b> in <b>myMother</b> and I can access its values by
typing <b>myMother</b> dot <b>firstName</b>. It's that 2nd one there.
Now we had <b>firstName</b> with the capital in there.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 542.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image542.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>So there we go, we can actually access these values for this
<b>object</b> here and I can make another <b>object</b>.
<b>myFather</b>, equals <b>new Person</b>. George Mead 85. Great, I know
something like that. And now I can access <b>myFather</b>. Right,
<b>lastName</b>. And you'll see that I get “Mead”.</p>
I can use this <b>constructor function</b>, to create <b>objects</b>
that are reusable <b>objects</b>, and can have different values each
time you create a new <b>object</b> from that <b>constructive
function</b>. And this is a very powerful pattern, that you'll see
frequently in, more sophisticated, more complex javascript programming.

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image543.webp"

  alt="3.05. Putting Objects and Functions Together." />
</p>
<p>Putting objects and functions together, this is a really powerful
pattern, and it's used frequently in more sophisticated JavaScript
programming, and we're not going to do anything in this course that's
going to really make use of a pattern like this.</p>
But I want to show it to you as we're talking about <b>objects</b>, so
you can start to think about ways in which you can use <b>objects</b>
and <b>functions</b> together that are very powerful.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 544.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image544.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Here on the left, you can see that we have a <b>function</b> called
<b>printableMessage</b>, and in that <b>function</b> there's a variable
called <b>message</b> which is, set to the value of 'hello'. Then we
have another <b>function</b> in here called <b>printMessage</b>, which
all it does is print out that value that's inside the message variable.
But I have another function called <b>setMessage</b>, which takes a
<b>parameter</b>, and what that <b>parameter</b> will do is it'll change
the value, of <b>message</b>, at least temporarily, you'll see in a
minute, and then what's really important here is that this
<b>function</b> returns an <b>object</b>, and the <b>object</b> that it
returns has two members as the <b>function</b> <b>printMessage</b> is
returned, and the <b>function</b> <b>setMessage</b> is returned.</p>
We can actually use this thing as a factory to create different values
for these <b>variables</b> within this <b>function</b>. We've talked a
bit before about <b>closures</b>, and really any function in JavaScript
is a <b>closure</b>. However, we've talked about <b>scoping
closures</b>, and this is a really good example of the power of a
<b>closure</b>, because we can actually assign <b>variables</b> that
hold <b>printableMessage</b>, and we can do different things with them
without actually affecting what's inside this <b>closure</b>.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 545.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image545.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Let's see how this works, and again, I strongly recommend that you
actually type this out into an HTML file or else in script tags. You can
see that it gets defined here. That will get to find,
<b>printMessage.</b>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 546.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image546.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Now I can make a <b>variable var</b> <b>awesome1</b>, equals
printable <b>message{}</b> there, and I can do, <b>awesome1</b>.
<b>PrintMessage{},</b> and it should run that function in there and give
me hello, but I could also make another variable var <b>awesome2</b>,
and assign it also that same function <b>PrintMessage</b>, like that. I
have assigned that the same <b>function</b> and here I can do,
<b>awesome2.setMessage</b>, I'm going to put in a new message,
<b>greetings</b> like so. What that will do, is it'll go in run this
<b>function</b> and say, new message greeting, a sign message greeting,
so that when I run print message, it's going to actually print that
message.</p>
<p>
Now if I do, <b>awesome2.printMessage</b>, I get <b>greetings</b>,
however, again, if I do </b>awesome1.printMessage</b>, I still get
hello. That's really interesting that I can actually use this pattern
here to set different values and then access those values in different
ways through different variables. It's a very powerful pattern and worth
being aware of, even though we're not going to do this thing a lot in
this course. But as we're talking about objects, it's important to talk
about how objects and functions together in JavaScript are very
powerful, and give you this opportunity to create things that are
reusable modules. That's a a key thing in any programming language is to
be able to do that.

3.06 Data Formats - XML (3:47)

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image547.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="3.06. Data Formats - XML." />
</p>
<p>
The next thing to talk about in our journey with Objects, is to talk
about data formats and to talk about data. Here, we're seeing a data
format called XML.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 548.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image548.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>If you look at it, it should look fairly familiar in the sense that
we have data that has been described using tags, and the tags look a
little bit like what you would see with HTML, except unlike HTML, where
you have certain set tags that browsers understand, you can use any tag
you want in XML as long as you open it and close it properly. You can
actually create whatever tags you want that will help describe your
data.</p>
<p>XML was and is a very popular format, has been for a long time. It
has certain advantages. One of the advantages is that, because you're
using tags to describe the data, it provides structure for the data,
that is easily understood. However, XML has largely been eclipsed by
another data format called JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object
Notation.</p>
Over here, we have a level graph here, about the popularity of these.
You can see JSON's going off the chart here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 549.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image549.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
This comes from this article over here, "The Rise of JSON." This is
interesting, about how JSON has become very popular. You'll also notice
this name, Douglas Crockford, was involved with the invention of this
data format JSON. We've talked about him before. XML is a valuable
format for data, but it's being largely replaced by JSON.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 550.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image550.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>If we look at JSON and Objects now, on the left you'll see something
that is JSON formatted strings. This is data in JSON format, again,
JavaScript Object Notation. On the right, you're seeing a JavaScript
<b>object</b> and you should notice that the two of these things look
very similar to each other.</p>
<p>The differences are; that on the left, the whole thing is a
<b>string</b>. You'll notice that there's a quote mark right at the very
top, and a quote mark right at the bottom. Then inside there, we've got
the curly braces with the key-value pairs. You'll notice that with JSON,
both the keys and the values are inside quotes, whereas in the Object,
only the values are inside quotes. This is an important difference
between the two, but other than that, they're very similar to each other
in the way they look and the way they act. We are familiar with this
format right from the beginning if you're already using Objects.</p>
To take a JSON string of data and turn it into an object in JavaScript,
is a trivial matter, as we'll see in just a minute because this is
something that happens a lot. A lot of times you're going to have data
in JSON format, and then you're going to convert that data into an
object that you can manipulate and use within your JavaScript program.

</p>
With this lesson, there is a example file, so I recommend you open up
that example file in Visual Studio Code or whichever code editor you're
using and work with that to see what you can do with that file, with
some JSON data.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 552.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image552.webp"
  style="width:50%;"

</p>
I have that file open over here. In it is just a variable called JSON
with a string of JSON data.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 553.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image553.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
We can do something with this, we could say <b>var user</b> equals
JSON.parse(json). Now let's see what happens. I'm going to console.log.
I'm just going to console.log the json variable up there, and that
should just give me my string of data.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 554/555.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image555.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Let's see what happens if I do that. If I go over to here, and then to
my file here and click refresh, you can see I'm just getting my string
of data. This is my raw data coming in here. Usually you're not going to
have your raw data built into a file. You're going to be getting it from
some external source, maybe from a database or from some 3rd party API.
We'll be talking about those later in this course. But for right now,
I've just built a little bit of JSON in here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

</p>
Next, I'm going to come to logout user and you'll see I'm going to
actually do a whole separate. When you see you can see both next to each
other. There's a user see that, and then come back here and refresh this
and you'll see. The first one is just the data, it's just the raw data.
The 2nd one has been turned into an object. This is now an object, so
that's what this parse method does here is it takes the json. This parse
method here takes that JSON and JSON.parse will take that JSON and parse
it and stick it into user. Now, it's an object that I can actually do
some things with.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 558.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image558.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
What can I do with it? I can do a number of things with it. I can access
the data so I could use user.last_name or user.social media[0] to get
into those elements and see what data is in there or
user.phone_numbers.mobile to get inside the objects, inside the object.
We can also change the values of an object. We talked about this a
little bit before, but I can just assign a new value. If I cancel log
user out again, you actually see that it's there. You can delete values.
I could say delete user phone numbers home. I've done the cord cutting
thing and I've gotten rid of my home phone number. Perhaps I want to
delete that from my object, from my data. If I can't log out users,
you'll see that it's gone. I could add objects, add values too to the
objects so I could have user.social_media[3] wordpress.com, if that's a
new social media place that want to add to my object, and you'll see
that each of these things works and runs in there. I recommend trying
some of these things out.

</p>
<p>If you go over here, and just add some calls to the console log, you
can comment these out. If you don't want to actually see them right now
and try some different ones, console.log. First user, first_name. It
should work if I come back here and refresh this, I'm getting Joe. You
can go through and try some of these different pieces here. I strongly
recommend that you do this just so you can see what happens when you're
working with data that comes in from JSON. You can do all the same
things because it's an <b>object</b>. Just practice working with
objects.</p>
One thing students tell me when I'm teaching JavaScript is I didn't
spend enough time on objects. Really, the truth is they didn't spend
enough time on objects. I'll tell you to do this stuff. But if you don't
do it, you won't get used to it and you won't get good at working with
JavaScript and objects.

<p align="center">

</p>
<p>The last thing here is occasionally you need to take an object and
convert it back into JSON or convert it into JSON. You can do that by
simply using the <b>JSON.stringify method</b> with the JSON
<b>object</b>, <b>JSON.stringify(USER)</b>. You might wonder, when would
you want to do that. Suppose you want to create an API, and you want
people to access your data. You might need to take some data that's in
some sort of object and turn it back into JSON. Or perhaps you want to
send that JSON data to something else, maybe a database or something
like that. It is possible to take data that is in JSON format in an
object, and turn it into a JSON string using the stringify method so you
could go back and forth between JSON and an object.</p>
<p>In this lesson we've learned a lot about objects and some of it takes
some practice. We'll be working with objects more in the course. But
really to get to more sophisticated use of objects, we would need to be
building bigger, more sophisticated programs and we're going to have
time to build in this course. But I want to at least introduce you to
the topics.</p>

</p>
<p>You can look it up in the Internet and see other all variations of
this game. In fact, at the end of this lesson, I'm hoping you can make
some of your own variations of this game and make it more interesting
than my variation of this game. We've been working in this course and
really for the whole specialization at creating Java scripts. You've
learned a lot about JavaScript so far. If you've been following along
and doing the exercises and really working through everything. But most
of the scripts we've worked on are fairly short and have a very limited
scope.</p>
<p>Now, as we get into working with data with JavaScript and we start
thinking about creating more sophisticated applications or scripts are
going to become longer. We really need to think about how we're going to
go about building them more carefully.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 564.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image564.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Let's start with this game of Pig. In the first place to start is
with the rules and the game of pig rules. The rules that we're going to
start with is that there are two players and each player takes turns
rolling a pair of dice. The total of the current players' roll is added
to their score unless either die comes up as a one. If that happens,
this player's turn is over and it becomes the other player's turn. After
each roll, the current player can either roll again with the hope of
adding to their score and assuming a one was not rolled, they can roll
again. Or if the player feels that luck is running thin for them they
can pass to the other player.</p>
<p>In our version of the game, the first player to get to thirty points
or higher wins. If a player roles two one's snake eyes that player's
current score gets zeroed out and they have to start over from scratch,
accumulating points from zero. Those are the rules that we're going to
play with, and the first thing to do is to really think about these
rules, to review them carefully, and think about the different things
you would need to make this game actually work in JavaScript. Before we
get into that, I want to also add that generally as programmers or in
these lessons generally, I present how to make these types of things in
a logical, a linear fashion. But it's really important to understand
that for myself as a developer, that's not how I develop them. I don't
just start at the beginning on line one of my program and type on
through to the end of the program with all the lines. As you get into
larger programs and more complex programs and programs that have
functions, they interact with each other. It's even less likely to be a
linear start to finish process.</p>
<p>What we need to do here, what I really want you to get out of this is
to recognize that even though, yes, we're going to go through and build
this pig game and yes, it's going to be presented in a logical, linear
way because otherwise, it would be really confusing. It's really
important for you to understand that that's not how the game was
created. That's not how I created it. To really think about the process
needed in order to go about creating something more complex like this.
It's a creative process and it's a circular process. You have to go over
things multiple times. It's more like vacuuming the rug where you go
over it than it is mowing the lawn where you go over it once and then go
on to the next row. That's going to be the process we go through here. I
strongly recommend that you do these steps in that you think about this
as thoroughly as you can before going into the lesson where we actually
build the game.</p>

With that said, do this with nothing more than those rules, that set of
rules, nothing more than the rules on that previous slide. What do you
notice about the game from a programming perspective? Get a piece of
paper, get a pen. Pause this lesson and jot down everything you can
think of. What data needs to be managed in the game? What will you need
to be able to keep track of during the game? What images are needed, if
any? What flow control structures, sequence, selection, loop, do you
think you'll need, and for which parts? What else comes to mind? Just
with nothing other than the rules. Sit down and take a few minutes to
think about this and to see what you can get, I'll go back to the rules.

<p>Here's the rules here. I mean, in the lesson here, and you should go
do that, take a few minutes to really try to map out what you think this
game consists of without actually seeing the game just based on the
rules.</p>

Here are the diagrams for the pig game to help you.

</p>
Okay, now hopefully you've taken a few minutes and jotted down some
notes just based on the rules. If you are creating a game from scratch
and you didn't have an example to go from of that game, that's all you
would have. You would have to start with that.

</p>
Now, here we're a little bit lucky in that this game already exists. So
we can actually reverse engineer it a little bit. We can actually go
play the game and take further notes based on what we observe while
playing the game. So I will provide a URL for this game.

</p>
It's the cpe-web-assignments.ucdavis.edu/pig-js. So you can actually go
to this website and play this game following the rules that I have. And
I recommend that you do this a few times. Play the game, pick the player
see what happens when you click the different buttons.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p align="center">

</p>
<p>What happens if you click Quit? What happens if you click Roll the
dice? Inspect the screen, use your inspector to inspect sort of what the
different elements are in the screen. And see if you can reverse
engineer of this game by just playing it a little bit and seeing what
happens as you play the game and how it actually works.</p>
<p>Play the game a few times, spend maybe five minutes playing the game
and right down spend five minutes writing down some items that you might
match what notes you took earlier. What items match what you took
earlier in your notes? What pieces of functionality can you identify?
Really look at it and think about, okay, what's going on here? There's a
button. What can you observe? There's a button when you click it, what
happens? How does that happen? Use that <b>inspector</b> to see what the
different parts of the page are. What happens in each part of those
pages as you're playing the game. Anything else you can notice, take
five minutes, just take five minutes and really write this out as best
you can to think about this.</p>
The number one thing students tell me that are new to JavaScript and new
to programming is that they can understand the script as we're putting
them together and they make sense and they can read them but they don't
know where to start. If they were to write something from scratch, they
wouldn't even know where to begin. So really this process is to help you
with that. We've done some other things in this specialization, such as
the challenges which build one, upon the next, upon the next, trying to
make you take baby steps as you move forward through the challenges to
build something a little bit more complex. And now we're at a point
where we're going to make a more complex script. And we really need to
think about, what are our strategies for doing that? Okay, so take these
five minutes, and go through, and write down whatever notes you can
think of that match what you thought from looking at the rules, does it
match? Are there things that are different than you thought? Are there
things that you're noticing that you didn't notice before, since you
have the advantage of having a existing version to deconstruct? What do
you notice there?

<p>Pause the lesson and do this before going on to the next part of the
lesson. Okay, hopefully you did that and you took some time, and wrote
down what you needed, and you went through the game, and you played it a
few times, and you've observed some stuff. Now, it's time to put on your
thinking cap and think about how would you go about creating this game
using JavaScript? What would you do? You've got some notes to review and
you've played around with the game.</p>
So, where would you start if you're going to create this game? How would
you go about it? What do you think is the hardest part? What are some of
the functions you might need to create in the game? What else do you
notice? What else is worth mentioning? Really think about this. And what
I recommend you do is stop here before going on and take a break from
this lesson. Go ride a bicycle, go take a walk, go do something else.
Something that will allow you to sort of chew on this for a little while
and then come back to it in an hour, or in a couple of hours, or in the
afternoon, or in the morning, or tomorrow, or something like that. Give
it some time, really percolate on this, and think about how you would go
about creating this program before going on with this lesson.

<p>In this next part of this lesson, I'm going to talk about my thought
process for how I go about solving these types of problems. And your
thought process in your problem solving process may be different from
mine and that's totally okay.</p>
<p>I just want to present my thought process because I think it will
help with understanding how to go about taking a bigger problem and
breaking it down into pieces, and that's something that a lot of people
just don't have a lot of practice with. So you have to practice doing
this to get good at it. This is not something you just know because
you're born knowing how to do it, it's something that you, it's a skill
that you developed by practicing it. Hopefully you went off and thought
about that and thought about how you would go forward, and at the end of
this you'll have a sense of how you think about this differently from
how I think about it.</p>
So I'm going to show you some diagrams here that will walk through how I
think about it, and you can create your own diagrams and you can just
draw them on pieces of paper. It's a good idea to do that, to help you
sort of think out the steps that you would need in order to do this.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 573.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image573.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>The first diagram demonstrates what I think of as the core of this
game. And usually for me, when I start a new project, when I start a new
challenge, I start with one of two things, either the hardest part, the
thing that I think is going to be the absolute hardest part to solve,
because if I have a project that I want to do and there's a difficult
piece to it and I don't know what that hardest part is going to be. If I
don't know if I'm going to be able to solve the hardest part of that,
then I want to solve that first before spending time on the easier parts
because I don't want to waste my time. That's one strategy. The second
strategy is what is the core, what is the absolute most essential part
of the program that you want to create? What is the absolute colonel
core of it? And that was my approach with this game.</p>
<p>When I think about this game, the core action of this game is a roll
of the dice. A player rolls the dice and something happens. So and then
decisions are made in the game based on what happens there. So what this
diagram shows is that we start with the roll of the two dice. The two
dice are rolled and then numbers come up and something, we're going to
have a decision tree here. What happens? Either one is rolled, either
two ones are rolled or no ones are rolled. So if no ones are rolled, if
that's true I can take the sum of those dice, of those to die of those
two dice and add that value to my score. And then I can decide do I roll
again.</p>
<p>If I decide to roll again I can roll the dice again and I can go
through that process again and eventually win the game. And otherwise if
I roll the dice and a one is rolled, I can check and see if I can see
one die a one while the other one isn't. If both the dice are ones then
I zero out my players score and my turn is over. If neither of the dice
are ones that I don't zero at the score, I just end my turn, and that
describes the process of a single throw, which to me, is the cornerstone
of this game.</p>
<h2 name="ch3-11">
3.11 Version Two (2), Three (3), &amp; Four (4) (6:51)
</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 574.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image574.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Having done the first version of my diagram, I start to think, well,
wait a minute here, I need to keep track of the score. And somebody has
won because the game is going to end, it's not just about the throws at
a certain point, you're going to stop throwing dice or switching turns.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 575.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image575.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>And when that happens, you're going to check to see if some sort of
winning condition has been met. So here you can see in this diagram I've
updated a little bit to check on that winning condition. I rolled the
two dice, again check to see if anyone's have been rolled and if none of
them have, I can add the sum to my score. And then I can check to see,
okay, what is that total score? And has the winning condition met? In
this case with our rules, with our set. Do I have a score that's greater
than 30 and if yes, then end the game is over. The game is going to
totally be over. If no, I can decide whether or not we going to roll
again and if yes, I can roll again and no, then my turn is over, but the
game is not over.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 576.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image576.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>That brings me to version 3 of my diagram here. And here in version 3
you can see that I start by throwing my dice and I roll the two dice if
no one's are rolled and then I add that some and I checked the winning
condition. And if the winning condition is not met, I now have a new
function called setup turn if I choose to roll again. So now I'm
introducing a new function in here because before in version 2 there was
a problem. In that when I end here, if the winning condition is met,
this end is representing both the winning condition having been met and
setting up a new turn for the other player if in fact it's their turn to
roll or I pass or something like that.</p>
<p>So both situations are handled here and I really need to separate
those out. Here I've got a new function called set up new turn (right on
image). If the winning condition is not met and I choose to roll again,
I'm going to set up a new turn. Conversely, if I roll a one and my turn
is over, I'm going to change a player and then set up a new turn for
that player. So that's looking a little bit cleaner. And now you have a
second function here called set up turn function. And in this function
I'm going to send a message in the game div to roll the dice for the
current player. I'm getting out of button to roll the dice for the
action div. And then when that button is clicked, that's when I run this
throw dice function that I have on the left. Now I've got a little
helper function there that's going to set up a turn. And I've started
splitting this out into some different versions, into some different
pieces here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 577.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image577.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Version 3 is still feeling a little bit complex to me so I decided I
wanted to modularize it a little bit more. Now I have a function that's
much cleaner and you can see just by the diagram how much simpler and
more clean than it is. And basically what I've done here is I've
separated out the winning condition function into its own separate
function that will check to see if I have achieved a winning condition.
This truly represents a throw within the game. You throw the dice, you
check to see if a one is rolled, if not you can add to the score and
decide whether or not to roll again. If you decide to roll again, you
can set up a new turn and then check to see if you've hit the winning
condition or not. If not you can change the player and then set up a new
turn and then also check to see if you've hit the winning condition or
not.</p>
<p>This is a much cleaner, much easier to follow diagram that gives you
a sense of what that function looks like. And then we can go on and see
what the check for the win condition is. I start and is the current
players score greater than the game end? If yes, you set the score area
with the message for that, win for that player. You can empty out the
action area and add a button for starting a new game. If no, you can set
the score area with the current score and then you're all set for the
next turn. That's what the winning condition would look like.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 578.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image578.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Now we've got three functions that are working together. One that
represents kind of the guts of the game, the throw of the dice. One that
is about setting up the turn for the next player or for the same player
setting up that next turn, getting that next turn ready, getting our
board ready. And one for checking the winning condition. And these three
functions are going to work together to create this game.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 579.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image579.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>In summary, one approach to thinking about a game, or about creating
a more complex script is to start at the most difficult part of the
script or the core functionality of the script and work from the inside
out. And that's what I've done here. I started with the core
functionality of what is the core functionality, it's throwing the dice.
And I worked out from there to think about the score, and to think about
changing players, and to think about other aspects perhaps of the game.
And I think doing this will really help you and get better at solving
programming problems and taking larger programming problems and breaking
them down into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>Look for ways to simplify the bigger problems and break them out into
modular pieces as much as you can. And to really think about which
functionality you need for each piece.</p>

<p>Hello and congratulations to making it to the fourth module and our
third course in JavaScript. In this module, we're going to build the
game that we started designing and planning in the third module. I think
you'll get a lot out of doing that. It's a fun game and at the end,
there are lots of ways you can take this game and expand on it or change
the rules or do something different with it. Let's dive in, break out
our code editors and our web browsers and have a lot of fun with this
project. We've had a lot of fun creating the material for you and I
think you'll get a lot out of it. Let's get to it.</p>

<p>This is just a very basic version of the game with very little
styling, so we can really just make it work. You can go back later, and
add some better graphics, and better styling on your own if you want to.
In fact, I hope you actually expand on this game quite a bit, and make
it your own. There are lots of ways to do that we'll talk about
later.</p>
<p>The other thing that's important to mention here is that the way I'm
going to show you how to build it is in a very linear way, starting from
the beginning and going to the end. But from the previous lesson,
hopefully you got that that's not the way I actually develop it or the
way many developers work, it's that they just start at the top and go to
the bottom. Usually you work from the inside out, and start with core
functionality and work out from there. That's the easiest way to start
thinking about how are you going to solve real problems that are
programming problems. I'm presenting it in this linear way because
otherwise it would be really confusing. But it's important to realize
that it's not developed that way, and that people don't necessarily
think in this very linear way.</p>

We've got an empty script tacked down here. This is where we're going to
be working. This is in this part of the page. Then also we have the
images of the dice that will be pulling up. This could go into a folder,
but at this point, I just have them in the main folder and that's fine.

Then over here, I have the page loaded up so we can actually test the
page here, and see how things are working as we go along, and work on
the page here.

</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do in our code editor, is create some
variables that we're going to use to access different areas of the page,
so it's really these variables here. I'm going to have <b>startGame</b>,
is going to be <b>document.getElementById</b> on it by the
<b>startgame</b>.</p>

<p>It's this button right here. Then I have <b>gameControl</b>, which is
this whole div, the <b>gameControl</b> div. Then I have <b>game</b>,
this is where the game is actually going to take place. If you go back
to the previous lesson, and pull up the game and play it, and inspect
it, you'll see that that's where the game takes place.</p>
<b>score</b> which calls the element id ‘score’. Then I have
<b>actionArea</b> which is get element by id of <b>actions</b>, and it
doesn't really matter if these are out of order here, but you can put
them in a different order. But let's just <b>get.ElementById</b>, I'm
just getting these id's for each of these elements. Make sure you get
this code in here first, because these are the different parts of the
board that we're going to need for our script.

<p>The next thing that you're going to need is an <b>object</b> to keep
track of the data in the game. This is a perfect use for an
<b>object</b>. We don't have to use an <b>object</b>. We could use
variables for this, but this is a perfect use for an <b>object</b>, and
allows us to practice what we've learned so far with <b>objects</b>, and
using <b>objects</b> to manage data.</p>
<p>Here I have an <b>object</b> called <b>gameData</b>. This
<b>object</b> has a number of members in it. The first three hold
arrays, the first one holds the <b>filenames</b> of all the individual
pictures of the dice. <b>1die.jpg</b> is going to have the die with the
one dot on it, and so on and so forth. The player's, <b>player1</b> and
<b>player2</b> so those are two <b>players</b>, so we’ll be switching
back and forth between those. Then we've got <b>score</b>, that's going
to keep track of the scores, the first zero is going to be for
<b>player1</b>, and the second zero is going to be for <b>player2</b>.
Each time you roll the dice, you're going to take the number that comes
up for that die, and stick it into roll1, and then the second die will
get <b>roll2</b>, and then <b>rollSum</b> will be the combination of
both of those added together.</p>
<p><b>index</b> is interesting because we're going to use <b>index</b>.
<b>index</b> is either going to be a zero, or a one. <b>Player 1</b> is
going to be zero, and <b>player 2</b> is going to be one. When
<b>index</b> is one, we're going to use that, number one, to go into the
player's array, and get <b>player2</b>. Or will be using <b>index1</b>
to go into the <b>score</b> and update the <b>score</b> of that second
zero in there, and the first zero would be <b>index</b> 0. That's why we
have <b>index</b> here. This is going to change based on which player
we're working with as we go through the game.</p>
Then we've got the <b>gameEnd</b>, which I have currently set to 29 so
that you can play the game really fairly quickly, and see how it works.
Or later you could bump that up to 100 or something like that, to a
score that's maybe a little bit more reasonable for the game.

<p>But let's go ahead and get this into our script file. I'm not pasted
in, you're going to have to type it, but I'm going to pasted in here so
that I've got all of these things in here. Make sure you put a comma at
the end of each one except for the last one.</p>
<p>I've got all my die's in here, notice the comma at the end, but no
comma there, comma at the end here, and make sure everything is right,
and labeled properly. We're on our way to creating the pig game.</p>

4.03 Start the Game (7:50)
</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 591.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image591.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Next we're going to start the game. And again when I was developing
this, I started with what happens when somebody throws the dice? But, I
think for the purposes of building our game from start to finish, it
helps to just start at the top and start at the beginning.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 592.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image592.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So, when somebody clicks this button here, we want to start the game. I
need to add a click handler for this button. I'm going to add an event
handler for clicking to the start game button.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 593.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image593.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So let's do that first, we have our start game button defined here,
which goes in and gets this button here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 594.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image594.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So, we're going to add in our script start game out event listener, and
we're looking for a click, and we're going to run a function. Like so,
and then we're going to put what happens in that function here. And we
are going to do something with the, I'm going to just put a comment in
here now. Change index, or randomly select index whatever we want to put
in there, just we're going to have to handle that. But before I do that,
I want to first just sort of get the correct html on the page.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 595.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image595.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>So, up here at the top of my page in this section called game control
here, I want to get now that I've clicked the button. I don't really
need it anymore, and I don't need to start game text anymore. So when
you use the inner html to change that game control there, so I can set
game control dot enter html. And I'm going to put in just an h2, the
game has started kind of thing. So let's do that,
<b>gameControl.innerHTML</b> equals. And I'm just going to use single
quotes here, h2, the game has started. You can make those title cases if
you wanted to might have done that on my my picture there.</p>
Then I want to add to that a button and I could just continue this
string here, gameControl.innerHTML plus equals. Don't forget the plus,
because that's going to add to the string that we already have here. And
the buttons can say, do you want to quit? And I'm going to close button,
and I believe I need to give that button an id. Yeah, we'll just give it
an id, id equals sore quote. Notice I'm using single quotes here and
then double quotes there. Alternatively, you could use the tick marks on
either end as well. Make sure you get your html right, okay. So we're
going to add that in there, that's great.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 596.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image596.webp"
  style="width:65%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
And now I just need an event listener for when somebody clicks the quick
button. So I'm going to say, document can I get element by id,
quit.AddEventListener, when you click that we're going to run a
function, like so. And what's going to happen in that function? We're
just going to do location.reload. And that refreshes the page, and then
you go back to the way the page was before. Okay, great, so when you
click the button, these things will happen and we'll get that working.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 597/598.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image597.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image598.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Let's just test this much and see if it works. If I come over here,
click refresh, when I click that I get the game has started, when I
click do you want to quit? It just refreshes the page, and puts it back
so that's working just fine the way it is. When the test is frequently
as we can there.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 599.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image599.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Now, the last bit is I also want to set that game index, the game
data index, I want to set that so that we can see that we're getting a
random player. So game data, is this object here. And so I'm going to
actually say, gameData.index this element, this can equal,
<b>Math.round</b>. And that will actually round that, I'm sorry
<b>Math.random</b>. That will actually generate a random number, between
0 and 1. And I want to round it, because I wanted to round up to either
1 or down to 0, because I want index to be 0 or 1. So I can do that on
the same line here, by putting <b>Math.round</b>, and then surrounding
that. So <b>Math.random</b> will pick a random number from 0 to 1. And
<b>Math.round</b> will round it up or round it down. Let's add a console
log so that we can really see what that's doing console.log
gameData.index, what is the value there and we'll test that and see.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 600/601.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image600.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image601.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
So let's come over here and I'm going to refresh the page to turn on my
inspector so I can get to the console log, console and randomly and I
got a 0. If I click want to quit, and pick again I'm getting 0 each time
here, there we go. Now I got a 1, so it's either a 0 or a 1 that's
coming up and I'm getting 1 a bunch of times. So each time you start the
game, you're either getting a 0 or 1, so that will pick one player or
the other. So hopefully, you can see here that index being a 0 or 1 is
going to choose player 1 or play or 2. This is 0, this is 1, okay,
great. We've got a good start at making our big game. Let's keep going
in the next lesson.

4.04 Set Up the Turn (6:39)

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image602.webp"

</p>
The next thing we need to do is set up the turn.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 603.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image603.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
We're going to create a <b>function</b> for that and remember, we're
going to have three basic functions in this game. One of them is
<b>setupTurn</b> we're going to have one for rolling the dice and then
we'll have one for checking the winning condition. It's really the way
these three functions work together that are going to determine how this
game works.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 604/605.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image604.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." /> <img src="./images/webp/image605.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>The first thing we're going to do really is the <b>setUpTurn</b>
function, and in that function we'll take game and we're going to set it
innerHTML to roll the dice for the correct player and we'll fill that in
as we go here. Then we're going to get that action area, we're going to
set it HTML with a button that allows us to roll the dice and then we'll
have an event with Center for that button, so that when you click, it
will actually roll the dice. At this point, we're just putting a console
log in there just to make sure that the buttons are working. Let's go
ahead and add this to our code over here. Down here, we've got my start
game event listener after the start game was then last minute ad
function set up turn.</p>
<p>The first thing I'm going to do here is <b>game.innerHTML</b> equals,
and I'm going to use my tick marks here and in there, I'm going to put
in a paragraph. You have to use the tick marks because I'm going to
include a variable in here in a minute. Roll the dice for player, acts
something like that is what that's going to say.</p>
<p>But who is player X? Instead of player X, I'm going to have a dollar
sign and curly braces, and in there I'm going to put my game data,
players, and the index because that's going to tell me which player I
had selected, whatever value got set here for game day to index. It's
going to be game data.players.</p>
<p>Remember, players is an array, that's going to have square brackets
and I put the index in there and that will go in and index is going to
be there is zero or one. That should go into my game data, find players,
and get either zero or one based on which number was rolled here. I'm
sorry, this needs to be game data.index, there we go. Because I need to
go back into that object game data.index. Game data players, game
data.index, and then I'll get that player.</p>
<p>Then we have action area.innerHTML, and this one can just be a
straight up stream. I'm just going to use the single quotes here and put
in a button with an idea set to roll, and I'm going to say sometimes
it's helpful to close that right away button like so and then it's going
to say, "Roll the dice." There we go. We've got a button that gets added
into to inner team up for the action area. We've got a button in the
action and now we need to have a click handler for that. I'm going to
have document.getelementbyID. Roll.outeventlistener, click.</p>
When we click that something's going to happen, we're going to run a
function like so. What are we going to do in here for? Right now, all
we're going to do in here is console.log roll the dice and will replace
this console log in a few minutes, but that'll give us a sense of
whether or not this is actually working. Now, when we've selected the
player of here, we now need to set up the term. I'm going to run set up
the term here, and we can leave this in here for now just for a moment
to see if that's going to work. But we're going to run set up the term
there so that we can get ready to roll the dice and see how that works.

<p align="center">

</p>
Let's test it. If we come over here and refresh the page, randomly
picked the first player, roll the dice for player two, I get a button,
when I click it says, "Roll the dice." If I click, do I want to quit, it
will go back and I could start again. At this point, just rolling the
dice will just keep giving me more of these, but that's working
perfectly. We're rolling the dice, we've set up our turn and we're ready
to roll the dice.

Throwing the dice. This is the core function in this program, and it's
the big function, it's going to take us some time to get this function
all working properly.

</p>
But we're going to get it started here. At this point, what we're doing
is we're going to clear out that <b>actionArea</b>, anything that's in
that <b>actionArea</b> we're just going to clear it out, and then we're
going to record the two rolls of each die. Record those rolls into our
<b>gameData</b> object. Then set the innerHTML for the message that's
going to go to the player about what was rolled, and also show those two
dice. Then we'll also sum up the total of those two dice and put that
into the <b>rollSum</b> property in the <b>gameData object</b>.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 609.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image609.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and get this started because this is an important one
to do. I'm going to add a function, function <b>throwDice(){}</b>, and
then in here, first thing I'm going to do is set the
"<b>actionArea.innerHTML</b>" equals. Then clear out that
<b>actionArea</b>. Then I need to set my values for my dice up here,
roll 1 and roll 2. <b>GameData.roll1</b> is going to be equal to, and
again, I'm going to do <b>Math.random</b>. That will generate a random
number between zero and one. But if I multiply it by six, and then I
need to round it down, <b>Math.round,</b> actually I want to do with
that floor. Then I want to add one to it. Because what this will
generate is a random number that's basically between 0-5. I want a
random number because my dice are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p>
<p>Now, you might wonder here, well, why couldn't I use
<b>Math.ceiling</b>? I could do <b>Math.random</b> times 5, and that
would give me a 0-5, and then round it up using <b>Math.ceiling</b>, or
<b>Math.ceil</b>. It gets rounded up from 0-1 to 1-2, 2-3, and so on and
so forth. If it's a partial number, then it'll get rounded up.</p>
But there's a very small error that could happen with that, which is, if
you remember what <b>Math.random</b> does, is it generates a number
between zero and one, but it's zero <b>inclusive</b>. It's very, very
unlikely. But possible that you could roll a 0.00000, in which case,
<b>Math.ceil</b> will not round that up to one, so you could potentially
get a 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 if you were to follow that methodology. We
don't want a zero, we want it always to be a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 to
match our numbers up there for our dice.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 610.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image610.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
<p>That's our roll 1. Roll 2 is exactly the same thing, we're going to
generate a new random number for that. Then we need to set a message on
our screen. We're going to put a message inside this game div here, and
that game div is going to say, <b>game.innerHTML</b>. We can just use
game because we define this variable up here that's going to go get that
thing. Game.innerHTML equals, and I'm going to use my tick marks again
because I'm going to use my variable in here. Open and close the P.
Especially when you're working with HTML inside of tick marks like this,
make sure you open and close it properly because your code editor won't
do the auto closing thing for you in this case, probably, unless you've
got some plugin that does it. I don't know of any, but there might be
some.</p>
Roll the dice for player x. Again, player x is going to be a variable.
Which variable is it going to be? Dollar sign, curly braces. It's really
just going to be this one again. This will be player 1, or player 2
here, that gets put in there.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 611.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image611.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
The next thing we need are the actual pictures of the dice. That's going
to go inside the same div, so I'm going to do game.innerHTML, plus
equals, to add to it, and again I'm going to use my tick marks, like so,
the semicolon and in here I'm going to put in an image tag, img src
equals quote quote, like so. That's going to be this. Then to get to one
of my images, it would be something like die 1, die 2, whatever that is,
but it's really going to be a variable. It's going to be dollar sign,
curly braces <b>gameData</b>. which element do I want up here? I want my
dice element,.dice square bracket, and which one do I want? Well, it
depends on what I rolled here for roll 1, we set roll 1 here. That's
going to be gameData.roll1. Actually I need to subtract one from it,
minus one. Because remember, this is going to be a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
If I roll a one, I need element zero from this array up here. I need to
subtract one there, gameData.roll1 minus 1. I think that's right. I
prefer to have double quotes here I think. Quote there, double quotes,
add an extra one for me.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 612.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image612.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
There we go. That will put in our source and really be good to have an
attribute as well for good HTML equals "die". You could even do this
thing again if you wanted to, I'm just going to leave it like that,
that's fine. We've added that image and that's the image for our first
roll. We need an image for our second roll, which is going to look
exactly like this, except, that this is now roll 2. Then the last thing
that we need to do is add up these two rolls together and put them in
their sum total. <b>GameData.rollSum</b>, that one there, is going to
equal <b>gameData.roll1</b> plus <b>gameData.roll2</b>, and that will
add those up and put them in there. Great. We're going to test this in
the next lesson.

<p align="center">

</p>
You've started your dice throwing function, so let's test it and see if
it works.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 614.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image614.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
All we really need to do to test it, is replace the console log in the
set up the turn function, and replace it with the throw the dice
function. Let's take a look and see how that works.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 615.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image615.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
All I need is to take this function here and copy it, and put it up
here. Actually there's another console log up here, let me just stick it
in there, throw the dice. It goes here. Instead of this console log,
roll the dice, it goes here. Make sure you put it in the right place,
don't make my mistake. In the setup, the turn functioning, we throw the
dice, so that one starts set up the turn, set up the turn, throws the
dice once the turn has been set up, and you click the "roll" the button
thing there. Let's see what that gives us. Let's save this and come over
here and test it.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 616.  (2xx) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image616.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Now, if I refresh and randomly pick a player that can roll the dice,
oops, error, file not found, 6die.jpgalt. I can see right here that I
forgot to close mine. This is very easy to have that happen when you're
working with HTML inside of the string.

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image617.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
I can see right here what's gone wrong. I can see that I forgot to close
something so it thinks that my whole image has this name on here, which
is incorrect. Let's go back over here. It's in here I forgot to put a
quote here. It's in one double quote, and I'll add two, but you have to
delete one of them there. There we go, save that.

</p>
Roll the dice. Now, I've got two dice and it showed up and I can say,
"Do you want to quit?" and start again, Roll the dice and make it two
different dice. You have to refresh the page or click, "do you want to
quit? each time to get this to work. If you wanted to go even further,
you could come in and add a console log, and see what gameData.rollSum
some has in it or would any other variable in there has if you're just
curious to see what's in there, you can save that.

</p>
Up here, maybe I don't need this one anymore. The one that's giving me
one and two, you just comment it out or you can delete it, you do
whatever you want to it. We don't need that one or two showing up
anymore. Let's go back and give that a try again. If I refresh, randomly
start the game, roll the dice, and you can see I rolled two sixes again,
that's something and got 12. Unfortunately, to do it again at this
point, you have to click the button or just click refresh. In here I got

I'm going to move this inspector to the side and it's going to be easier
to see what's going on if it's there. That's all working and working
really nicely. Now we have a dice game where we can throw the dice, and
two dice are roll and randomly we generate those two images and display
them on the page, and that's fine.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 622.  (314) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image622.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="." />
</p>
Now, the next thing to do is to figure out, what do we do from here? We
need an if statement. You need some if statement that says, if two 1s
came up, in other words, if the rolled sum is a two, then we're going to
do one thing. That's going to start at zero. If one of the two like in
this case here. If one of the two dice came up a one, then we do
something else, we need to swap. [inaudible].

<p align="center">

<p>
We're going to add if statements into our throw dysfunction here.

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image624.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Roll a two? Or not." />
</p>
<p>
So if the first one is if game data don't roll some is the same as
exactly the same as two. The only way you get a two is if you've rolled
to once, if it's exactly the same as a two, then we're going to say
something like console log, snake eyes. We'll fill this out later with
more specific instructions.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 625. test, game of pig (316) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image625.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Test, Game of Pig." />
</p>
<p>
But for right now I just want to know, I just want to capture that
situation and then we've got an else if. Yeah and we want to check two
values. We want to check the value of roll one and the value of roll two
and if either one of them comes up a one, we want to do.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 626. test, game of pigs (316) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image626.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Test, Game of Pig." />
</p>
<p>
So that will come back true if either one of them is a one. So the way
to do that is to say if game data dot roll one is the same as one or
there's two pipes, game data dot roll two is the same as what. If that
situation occurs, then console dot log one her A1 was rolled, your turn
is over and then we've got the else. And for that, we can just copy
this, paste it and saying the game continues, Roll again or pass and
we'll deal with that separately.

So now we've got three situations to deal with here. Let's just make
sure that this all works the way we expected to and come back here and
refresh this, pick my player, roll the dice. I got an eight. The game
continues roll again or pass. I got two fives. The game continues roll
again or pass. I'm not getting anything. Okay, here I got a one, a one
was world, your turn is over. You can keep going along and seeing that
these numbers add up correctly and that it's doing the right thing until
you've gotten all of those things checked.

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image631.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Snake Eyes!" />
</p>
<p>
We'll fill out each of these if statements, but we'll do Snake Eyes
first. If we get a 2, let's deal with that.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 632. add to the innerhtml of the game (319) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image632.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Add to the innerHTML of the game." />
</p>
<p>
First thing we're going to do is add to the innerHTML of the game, and
say something that tells us that we got snake eyes. Let's do that, so we
can alert the player that they got snake eyes. So in here,
game.innerHTML +=, += because we're going to add to it, and something
like, Snap, let's close paragraph first. Correct, good practice there,
Snap, You got snake eyes! Something like that. So, it's going to just
put a paragraph in there, that has that.
</p>
<p>
The next thing that happens is that the score for that player gets
zeroed out. So <b>gameData.score, [gameData.index]</b>, Is going to be
set to 0. We set that back to 0 gameData.score. So, that means we're
going up into this gameData finding the score for whichever player it
is. If index is 0 will set this one 0, if index is 1 will set this one
to 0. So, we're setting it to 0 there because we're zeroing out their
score because that's what happens if you roll to ones as you lose all
the points you've gotten so far.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 633. snake eyes! (320) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image633.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Snake Eyes!" />
</p>
<p>
Then we need to switch players and we could do this with an if
statement, if index is 0 set it to 1. If it's 1 set it to 0, we could do
an if else statement there, but there's kind of a nice shortcut way of
doing that. And that's using what's called the <b>ternary operator</b>.
We see it over here, so I'm going to set <b>gameData.index</b>.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 634. gamedata.index true or false? (320) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image634.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="gameData.index, true or false." />
</p>
<p>
So, what happens here in <b>ternary operator</b> is we evaluate whether
or not this is true <b>gameData.index</b>. And remember in JavaScript 0
is false and the <b>gameData.index</b> is either going to be 0 or 1. So
if it's 0, then it's false, in which case will set it to 1. If index is
true, if it's set to 1 then it's true, in which case will set it to 0.
So, that's kind of a nice one line way of doing an if else, when you're
choosing between two things, you can only choose between two things. If
we had three players, this wouldn't work, because we would have to do
some if else statements for that. But with two players we can just say
it's either a 0 or 1. If it's a 1 change it to 0, if it's 0 change it to
1 like that. So, it's kind of a nice one line way of doing this and our
function is getting quite long.
</p>
<p>
So, anything we can do to shorten it up is kind of nice. So gameData,
.index? And then in parentheses I'm going to put gameData.index = 0.
Because if this is true, I want to set it to 0 or we use a colon here,
gameData.index, = 1 because if it's false, if that's 0, I want to set it
to 1.
</p>
<p>
And then what we're going to do is we're going to wait a couple of
seconds because we want this. Snap snake eyes is rolled on the screen
for a minute or not a whole minute but a few seconds, so that whoever is
playing the game can actually see it up here. So I'm going to use
setTimeout to just wait two seconds before I run setUpTurn again. Run
the setup turn function again which will put us back with the correct
player. So, let's go ahead and add that setTimeout there.
SetTimeout(setUpTurn, after two seconds, 2000 milliseconds) and that
should work.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 635. test, game data roll (321) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image635.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Test, game data roll." />
</p>
<p>
Now, if we wanted to test this before we go forward, it might be a good
idea to do that. What we can do is we could just come in here just
temporarily set gameData.rollSum == 2. So no matter what we roll in this
rollUp here, this things can get set back down to 2. And then this thing
should run and change my player, wait two seconds and set up the turn.
That way, we don't have to sort of keep playing and rolling until we try
to get two 1s to pop up randomly in order to test this. So let's throw
that in there and see what happens here.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 636. roll the dice as player 1 (322) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
If I come over here and test this, I can run my first player, roll the
dice, it comes up with 11. But then it waits 2 seconds and it says roll
the dice for player 2, let's try that again.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Roll the dice for player 2, I roll the dice, I actually got to 1 that
time, but it's switched into 2, 2 announces roll the dice for player 1.
So you can see that it's actually changing the player, waiting 2 seconds
and changing the player, so that's actually working, which is great. Now
remove console gamedata.rollsum = 2 which was hard-coded for testing the
switch players function.

<img src="./images/webp/image639.webp"

  alt="Again, a '1' is rolled." />
</p>
<p>
To start with, we're going to swap the players right off the die. If
anyone was rolled, either of the two dice comes up a one, then we're
going to swap the player. Let's do that first because that's just using
the ternary operator again.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image640.webp"

  alt="Ternary operator." />
</p>
<p>
Let's come back here and get this ternary operator here. You can just
copy and paste it and stick it down here in place of that console log.
Again, what that does is it sees what the value of index is and it
determines if this statement comes back, true or not. Remember, index is
either going to be a zero or a one. If it's a zero, it's false. If it's
a one, it's true because remember truthy and falsy in JavaScript, so a
zero in JavaScript is falsy. If it's false, then it's going to do this.
It's going to switch it to one. If it's true, then it's going to switch
it to a zero.

</p>
<p>
I have a page loaded from the MDN Web docs that will talk more about the
ternary operator. If you're more curious about this particular
expression in JavaScript or this operator in JavaScript, it's worth
taking a look at this page here. We've got that.

</p>
<p>
The next thing we need to do is just set the game index. We're going to
add to that instead of adding, you rolled snake eyes, we're going to say
sorry, one of your rolls was the one switching to the other player.
Let's go ahead and put that thing in there and then we'll set up the
turn again. That's basically all we need for this else if here. In here,
<b>game.innerHTML</b> plus equals. We're going to use our tick marks,
again, the semicolon, and in here, we're going to add a paragraph P.
</p>
<p>
You rolled a one switching to other player and really other players
going to be a variable dollar sign, carry braces, and really what we
want is this one here. This is the reason why we wanted to do this line
first because we just switched that index. If we were on player 1, now
the index is set to the other player. If we were on player 1, this will
just say player 2, if we were on player 2 here, this will say player 1.
That goes back and forth. Then down here we just need to set time out
and runs out of time again. That will work, that should work just fine.
</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 643/644. test, roll the dice (226) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="gameData.roll." />
</p>
<p>
Again, we can test it up here by forcing one of these roles,
gameData.roll1. I'm going to set that equal to one. Just to test it.
It's not perfect, but I just want to see it without having to roll a
bunch of times until I get a one. That certainly comes up more
frequently than rolling two once. Let's refresh this. Roll the dice for
player 1, you roll the one. I didn't roll the one, but because we set it
to say one of those dice, it's going to be one, it's doing it
automatically. Roll the dice for player 2, you roll the one switching
the player 1, and now roll the dice for player 1, roll the dice. You
roll the one switching for player 2, roll the dice. You roll the one
switching for player 1.

</p>
<p>
You can see it switching back and forth now and working perfectly every
time. That's exactly what we want there. We want to come back and remove
this gamedata = 1 because that will really screw things up later if we
forget to do that. Great. We've gotten both the situations for what
happens if you roll two once or if either of the dice come up with one,
we've gotten this sussed out. Next, we need to figure out the else,
which is what happens when we want to continue the game and continue
moving on with the game.

</p>
<p>
And basically, what we need to do is we need to update the score for
whichever player had them. We're going to take the score they had before
and add the <b>rollSum</b> to it in order to update that score. So let's
do that first.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

</p>
<p>
So, when you get rid of this, And say <b>gameData.score</b>, And the
<b>score</b> is going to be for the <b>gameData.player</b>. I want to
visit <b>GameData.index</b>, that's what I do square bracket. Okay,
<b>score</b> for a <b>gameData.index</b>. So that's either going to get
me up here on score. That's going to get me either this one or this one,
one of those two <b>gameData.index</b>. And that's going to = the
<b>gameData.score</b>, it's really this line again. +
<b>gameData.rollSum[]</b>. Like that, I believe. Let me check over here
and make sure I did that, right? <b>gameData.index +
gameDtaa.rollSum</b>, correct. Okay from there, what we need is to set
the action area and create two buttons in there.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image649.webp"

</p>
<p>
That action area is going to get set with two buttons, one for rolling
again or for passing. So, let's go ahead and do that and that's just
simple HTML they were letting javascript generate there. So
actionArea.innerHTML = open and close, quote there and I'm going to have
a button close button. Well, color, roll again, And it's going to have
an id = "rollagain", something like that. So there's that, or we're
going to do another button, open and close it, And in there put Pass and
that what's going to have an id, id = "pass". So, you notice how I do
that from the inside out for even typing this stuff because that will
keep me from making mistakes. That will help me from making mistakes, I
might still make mistakes, but that'll help, okay?
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image650.webp"

</p>
<p>
So we're going to set that and then we need two event listeners for each
of those things. So, I'm going to have an event listener
<b>document.getElementById(roll again).</b> And that's going to have an
<b>addEventListener</b>, and listening for a click. And when you click
the button we're going to run a function.

</p>
<p>
And for now we're just going to put in here, setUpTurn, we're going to
run that function again. Great, so if you roll again, when you click
that button to roll again, you just set up to turn again and the player
hasn't changed or anything. However, we're going to have another one of
these and I can just copy this and paste it and change this to pass.
</p>
<p>
And we're going to run setUpTurn again, but before we do that we're just
going to swap the player. So we can just copy that ternary operator and
stick it in here. And that will allow me to swap the player to the other
player. Cool, the last thing we're going to need in here is we're going
to need something that checks the winning condition.

<p>
So, we'll check the winning condition in here as well, but we'll do that
later. For right now let's just test this out and see if it works. Come
over here, refresh the page, pick my player when I roll the dice, I get
it a 2 in a 6, that adds up to 8. I don't have any scoring going on down
here yet, but I can choose roll again.

</p>
<p>
And it says roll the dice for player 1 and now I got a 1 and a 3 year
old one, switching to player 2. Roll the dice, I got a 2 and a 4, I can
click roll again and I'm still on player 2 and I can roll the dice
again.

</p>
<p>
Now, I got a 5 and a 5, and I could pass if I wanted to, if I click pass
it sets up the turn but changes it to player 1 because of that ternary
operator. And I can roll the dice for player 1 and I got a 6 that I
could choose roll again. So that's all working great, it's working
perfectly fine just the way it is, excellent. Let's stop there and we'll
pick it up in the next lesson.

<p>
So this really long function, <b>throwDice</b> goes all the way down to
this closing curly brace here.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 661. add if..else for winning conditions (334) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image661.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Add if..else for winning conditions." />
</p>
<p>
Let's add another function down here. Function
<b>checkWinningCondition</b>. And this function is going to have an
<b>if else</b> statement in it. The if statement is going to handle with
what happens if you have actually achieved the winning conditions. So if
winning condition met or else show current score. If we haven't won, we
at least ought to know how close we are to winning? So it's going to do
those two things.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 662. check player score against gameend (334) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image662.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Is player score (gameData.score) greater than gameData.gameEnd?" />
</p>
<p>
To check the winning condition, we just need to get this players score.
Get that players score and see if it's greater than
<b>gameData.gameEnd.</b> If that's true, then we need to do some things.
We want to set the score area of the page to say this particular player,
player one wins. Player x wins with x points, something like that. But
player x is going to be variable. So we're going to do ${}. And in there
we're going to say, where's my player thing when I switch players? It's
up here. So play, that's going to be their player winner, player two
wins with x points. And in there goes this game data score index, this
thing here because that's the score that we got.
</p>
<p>
What else do we need to do? I'm going to clear out the action area and
then we make a, get element by Id quit. I mean that button that's up at
the top of the page, I'm going to set its innerHTML to start a new game.
So let's just do that. ActionArea = " ". We're just clearing it out,
that's all we're doing there. And then we're going to say
document.getElementById("quit") that button there. I mean I'd say it's
innerHTML. It's going to be start a New Game, something like that. Once
we've won, we can start a new game. Cool, so that's the if statement
that we'll check to see. If the game has won, we will start a new game.
And the next lesson, we'll fill out the show current score section of
this <b>function</b>.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch4-12">4.12 Show the Current Score (8:33)</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 663. show the current score (4.12) (335) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image663.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="4.12. Show the Current Score." />
</p>
<p>
Okay, so now we need to show the current score, and make sure that that
gets filled out properly, if we haven't won the game, so let's go over
and add this.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 664. showing the current score (336) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image664.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Showing the Current Score." />
</p>
<p>
We're going to set the score areas innnerHTML to a paragraph that shows
the scores of both players. So we can say <b>score.innerHTML</b> = and
I'm going to just put in here some tick marks and a paragraph. Like so,
and then in here I'm going to say something this score for player one 1
is x, and the score for player 2, is y something like that. Now player 1
is going to to be replaced with the variable, Curly braces, and again,
player 1 is this thing here in players index. Well, I just need players
<b>gameData.players[0]</b>, is going to be something. And what score is
that going to be? This is going to be a variable here, curly braces, and
again add the dollar sign. And in there we're going to say,
<b>gameData.score[0]</b>. So that's the first player's score, and then
we're going to do the same thing down here, For a player two, Except
that's going to be 1, And this is going to be the same thing down here,
Except that's going to be 1.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 665. function checkwinningcondition (337) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

</p>
Now you could even make it stand out a little bit more by putting a
strong tag around each of these things. And you could do much better
than this for coming up with sort of a nicer interface for this. But,
But this will take care of us for the moment. There we go. So we're
going to put that into the score and, then we're ready to continue I
believe that's all we need let's just see over here, yep. Players[0]
player[1] looks good, that all looks good all right great, so what do we
need to do to get this to work?
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 666. function checkwinningcondition (337) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image666.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="function checkWinningCondition." />
</p>
We need to run this function, Here, check winning condition, It's not
the only place we need to run it, but let's start with that. Let's put
it there.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 667/668. test score 0 to 8 (338) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image667.webp"

<img src="./images/webp/image668.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Again, test score console log 0 to 8." />
</p>
Let's test this, make sure you save the file and then we're going to
come over here, and refresh my page, and start my game, roll the dice
for player 1. So now I've got eight and I've got no player 2 is running
here, and you can see that the score got added up, player 2 has 8
points. I can click roll again and it takes me to set up the term,
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 669/670. test score 0 to 15, then 0 to 25 (338) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image669.webp"

<img src="./images/webp/image670.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Test Game of PIG, score 0 to 25." />
</p>
and I can roll the dice for player 2, again and I've got 15. Okay so 2
two is 15, I could roll again, roll the dice again takes me to set up
turn. Now I've got 25, and if I get five or more this we should have the
end of the game and that should trigger it so let's see what happens.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 671. test game player 2 wins with 33 (339) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image671.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Test Game of PIG, player 2 wins with 33 points." />
</p>
Roll the dice, and player 2 wins with 33 points, and now up here I have
started new game, it still says roll again or pass so that's something
that needs to be dealt with.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 672. test start game of pig with console.log (339) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image672.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Test Game of PIG, with console.log of score." />
</p>
But, We can start a new game up here, what happens if I click roll
again? Now I've got an error up here, so that's something that we need
to deal with here. Roll the dice, what if I choose pass? If I choose
pass it says roll the dice for player 1, roll the dice, and now I got a
one so it's going to wait two seconds and set up for a player 2 and I
can roll the dice for player 2. So there are a couple of things that we
want to fix here, and one of them that's less obvious because we haven't
done it yet, but if you roll two ones, you also need to fix that there
as well. So that because that's going to change the score, so we want to
show the score if you roll two ones.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 673. function: checkwinningcondition (340) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image673.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Run function: checkWinningCondition." />
</p>
So let's go back to our code over here, And I want to run
<b>checkWinningCondition</b>, Up here, if you roll two ones I'm going to
run it here as well, because that's not going to have a win when you're
not going to get a win if you roll two ones, but the score is going to
change. So if you roll two ones then that player score get zeroed out
and you want to be able to see that, so we'll put
<b>checkWinningCondition</b> there as well, actually we'll put it before
this set time out. Doesn't actually matter, the set time out will wait
two seconds anyway, but I'm going to put it before that, there we go, so
that helps.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 674. if win, set action area (341) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image674.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Set action area when you win." />
</p>
The other thing we need to do down here is that, if you've won the game
I was setting the action area, actually this is what I'm missing
.innerHTML, that's what I was missing from before,
<b>actionArea.innerHTML</b> set that to blank, so that that will get rid
of those buttons that I had there by accident.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 675. test game of pig (341) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image675.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Test Game of Pig." />
</p>
Now there's one more thing that we can do to make this work a little bit
better but let's just test this again, just to make sure it's all
working, right? Roll the dice, roll again, Roll again and that's working
and then okay, we got switched to the other player, whoops get switched
back, poor player 1 is still at 0. We're rolling lots of 1s here, just
by pure random luck, It be kind of nice if we roll the double 1. All
right finally, player 1 is on the board, sorry, player 1, And if we roll
again, no, got switched again, there we go. Player one got snake eyes so
he got set back to 0, player 1's having a bad game and player 2 wins.
And then we don't have the buttons there because we cleared that out
properly, the only thing you can do is start a new game. So that's all
working perfectly fine, so that's great. We will stop this lesson here
but in the last lesson we will talk about some things that we could do
to clean up a little more, just this final cleanup stuff.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 name="ch4-13">
4.13 Final Clean-Up (8:08)

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image676.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="4.13. Final Clean-Up." />
</p>
Okay the game is working and that's great, and everything is working the
way it should. So that's excellent. But there's one thing that I would
like you to notice which is that when you roll the dice for the player,
when you roll again it's going to set up turn which says roll the dice
for player 1. But it'll be kind of nice if hopes I get snake eyes there,
it'll be kind of nice if when I roll the dice again if I click roll
again, it just rolls them again. I don't really need to go back to the
setup turn at this point, I could just roll the dice again. So what can
we do about that?
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 677. replace setup turn with throw dice (343) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image677.webp"
  style="width:40%;"
  alt="Replace function setup turn with throw dice." />
</p>
What if down here, in here when we go to roll again instead of doing
setup turn we just run this <b>function</b>. Throw the dice instead of
setup turn here. I think that will work, so let's go back and test that.
Now, when I start the game and I rolled the dice for a player 2, hope I
get snake eyes again. There we go. Now when I click roll again it just
rolls again, and you can see that the score is getting added nicely.
It's a bit smoother so that works great, okay?
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 678/679. find and cleanup where possible (343) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image678.webp"

  alt="Using best practices, cleanup where possible." />
<img src="./images/webp/image679.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Using best practices, cleanup where possible." />
</p>
A couple other things to clean up this thing here is really long, and
you could turn it into a separate little helper function. I don't know
if it's really necessary, but you could make a function called show
current score and make sure you put it in the winning condition, and you
could move it also into the IF statement for the throw dice. Yeah, we
could put it in a couple of different places here. Let's do this just to
see just kind of little helper function here. I'm going to say function,
<b>showCurrentScore</b>, and it's really just going to be this stuff
just because it's kind of long. And then, really all we need to do is
run this function here, <b>showCurrentScore</b>.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 680/681. change to showcurrentscore (344) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image680.webp"

  alt="Change checkWinningCondition to showCurrentScore." />
<img src="./images/webp/image681.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Change checkWinningCondition to showCurrentScore." />
</p>
Now, we don't need to run check winning condition up when you run snake
eyes because you're not going to win there, but we need to run show
current score. Instead of <b>checkWinningCondition</b>, we can change
this to <b>showCurrentScore</b>. And that makes a bit more sense because
that's what we're doing it. We're showing the current score, nobody's
going to win when they rolled two ones that's going to zero out their
score. And we want to show the current score, but we don't really need
to check the winning condition. We don't need to do the top part of this
IF statement here, we just need to do this bottom part which is showing
the current score. So, that's a little bit cleaner and a little bit
nicer like that.

<img src="./images/webp/image683.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="If function is used more than once, split off." />
</p>
<p>I think the next thing I wanted to talk about is this throw dice
function is really long. Now, you could potentially break out these IF
statements into separate little helper functions to get it to be a
little bit shorter.</p>
<p>Since none of this stuff is going to be used more than once, there's
not really a huge reason to do so. I'm going to leave it the way it is.
But you could think about what you would do to create little helper
functions and run them in these if/else statements, basically pull the
guts out and put them in their own separate functions. And you might
want to try it just to kind of get used to working with that kind of
idea, and it would help make that throw dice function a little bit
shorter, which would be kind of nice as well.</p>
You could also make a separate function that just contains the whole
selection statement, if/else, if and the else statement and make that
into a separate function that runs here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 684/685. script.js with all functions (345) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img src="./images/webp/image685.webp"
  style="width:45%;"
  alt="Move all functions into one script file for ease." />
</p>
The next thing to do is to apply some of our best practices to this,
which would be to create a separate script file because now we got a
bunch of JavaScript at the bottom of the page. It's probably a good idea
to make a new file here and call it script.js. And on that file we could
take all of our script from the top here, all the way down to the bottom
of the script tag here, cut it and stick it on that script tag over
there. And in fact, I'm going to put in my immediately invoked function
here. I'm going to have parentheses and in there, I'm going to run a
function which has its own parentheses, in its own curly braces and a
set of parentheses after that, in a semicolon. And then, I'm going to
click between the curly braces and move that down and add my <b>use
strict</b> directive to make sure I didn't screw up in any of my
variables and then paste everything here.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 686. change vars to const in javascript (346) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/webp/image686.webp"
  style="width:50%;"
  alt="Update all var to const to speed things up." />
</p>
<p>
So that puts everything in there, and then you could go through, and you
could change all of these <b>vars</b> to <b>const</b>. And in fact in
this entire <b>script</b>, all of the <b>var</b> declarations can be
<b>const</b>. I think even the game data where the actual data changes,
but the actual function, the actual variable doesn't change. That can be
a constant as well.

</p>
<p>So we saved that, and then we come over here, and we move this up,
and we're going to link to <b>src=“script.js”</b>. And you could move
this up to the top of the page with the <b>differ</b> attribute on there
as well. So that's all working. That's good. We've done all of the
cleanup stuff. We have one last thing to talk about, but I'm going to do
that in the next lesson, and you've got a working game here.</p>

<p>
Now you have a pig day scheme that works and functions and it's pretty
basic and that's great because we were able to plan and strategize a way
of making a few different functions work together, to come together to
make a game. That's definitely more complex than any of the scripts that
we've done in the first course of the the second course of the
specialization. It's a good medium place to be in terms of creating more
complicated scripts. But the game itself could be extended in lots of
different ways, and my hope is that you will take this and run with it
and do some interesting things with it. I've given you some ideas for
some things you could do that are not too hard and some that are more
challenging if you really want to try to do them.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 690. easy ways to extend the game (module 4.14) (348) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p align="center">

  alt="Easy ways to extend the game."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000;" 
  width="40%;" />
</p>
<p>
The first is when you roll a one, it zeros out the cumulative score for
that turn. If you think about this game the way it is now over here,
when you play this game, there's no reason to ever click pass, really.
You're just going to roll again until you get a one. There's no
strategic reason to ever click pass. But what if you roll the one, you
lose all of the points that you gained during that turn.
</p>
<p>
Remember, rolling two ones loses all the points you've got in the game
so far, but rolling one one could lose all the points you've gained for
the turn. If you've got a couple of big rolls in there, you've rolled
the nine, you've this 12 or whatever. Now pass could be strategically
something that you want to do. Again, it's still just dumb luck as to
whether you're going to win or lose, but pass could be more strategic.
If you were going to do that, if you were going to add that feature into
this game, what would you need to do? What would you need to add? I
don't think it would be all that difficult. I think you could go back to
your object up here, and you could create another variable that says,
turn some, or something like that, and each time a value gets added to
the turn some, you can increase that variable. If a one is rolled,
you're going to subtract that from that player's score. They lose those
points for that turn.
</p>
<p>
Just by adding one more property into the game data, you could add that
feature in fairly easily. You just have to remember to update the rules.
But that's just one way of updating the scheme. There are other easy
ways you could make some better graphics or better interface, make it
look nicer, make it clear whose turn it is and what the score is. None
of this stuff is working terribly well over here for what I have so far.
It's okay but it's not. It's certainly not great. You can make it much
better. That's something you can do that doesn't even involve a lot of
programming that's really just design work.
</p>
<p>
You can create form fields for the players name so that instead of
player 1 and good player 2. When you start the game, when you click,
Start. Instead of randomly pick a player, you could actually enter and
you get to form fields here. Player 1 and player 2. Add those form
fields in there. Again, you could replace these things here with the
names that somebody types into the field so that it's not just player 1
player 2. You could do that thing, that would be more challenging, but
would be a fun thing to do. You could replace the dice with cards.
There's no reason why it has to be dice.
</p>
<p>
You could make a cool card game. There's no reason that it has to be
1-6. You could have 20 possible cards for each person and have more
values. What would you need to change in order to do that? You could
allow the player to set a threshold for what wins the game. Right now
it's up to 30, which isn't very much, and you could just manually up it
to 100. But what if when you start the game, you have a field that says
or it could you even be a drop down field for 30, 50 or 100, whatever
you want, and the player picks what the threshold for winning is going
to be for that game. You could do that. That would be an easy thing to
add into the game. Again, it's just updating the data in that game data
object at the top of the game.
</p>
<p>
Then there's some more challenging ways to extend the game. You get add
more players. Where if you had three players or four players or what if
you could choose how many players you wanted to have playing the game.
What would you have to add in order to do that, that's a little bit more
complex because now that game index thing at the top of the page needs
to be different. This needs to work differently because it's not going
to just be a zero or one in or ternary operators are no longer going to
work because those will only handle two values, either one or zero. But
you can certainly do it. That wouldn't be that hard. That would be
something more to do.
</p>
<p>
You could add more dice. What if you add more than two dice? What if you
had three or four, you could add other conditions that affect the game
score. What if somebody rolls two sixs' is what happens then? Maybe
their score doubles? I don't know. You could do all fun things with
these. There are lots of other ways that you could think of to come up
with extending this game. That's your next job, is to really think about
some things that you could do to extend this game and make it a more
interesting better game. I look forward to seeing what people post on
the discussion board. I'll check in from time to time and see what
excellent versions people have made of the big game.

Congratulations for making it to the end of our third course on
JavaScript and therefore, of course, specialization. We've done a lot.
You've learned a lot of JavaScript so far. In the first course we
covered a lot of basics, a lot of basic syntax. We did a lot of
challenges to get good at that syntax, and the second course, we
introduced <b>jQuery</b> and we created some great interface elements
that are very simple and easy to integrate into web pages. In this
course, we've gotten even deeper into it with <b>jQuery plug-ins</b> and
we even created a game.
</p>
<p>
So with all of this, you've really developed a lot of JavaScript skills
so far. We have a fourth course in the specialization, and in that
course, we'll get even more complex scripts, and I promise you're going
to learn even more JavaScript and you'll get even better at it and
you'll get more practice. So I look forward to seeing you there.
</p>
<p>
.the end…
